name: LIAR binary # project name
description: LIAR dataset with binary labels, 64 cells, 10 epochs, batch size 32, max sentence length 100. # little description

files: # assign files to reference name
  states: states.hdf5 # HDF5 files have to end with .h5 or .hdf5 !!!
  train: train.hdf5 # word ids of training set
  test: test.hdf5
  words: words.dict # dict files have to end with .dict !!
  predictions: predictions.hdf5
#  true_classes_train: true_classes_train.hdf5

# OPTIONAL: If you have information about word embedding
# word_embedding:
#   file: embed
#   path: weights

word_sequence: # defines the word sequence
  file: test # HDF5 file
  path: words # path to table in HDF5
  dict_file: words # dictionary to map IDs from HDF5 to words

states: # section to define which states of your model you want to look at
  file: states # HDF5 files containing the state for each position
  types: [
        # {type: state, layer: 1, path: states1}, # type={state, output}, layer=[1..x], path = HDF5 path
        {type: state, layer: 1, path: states_test, transform: none}  # *4* no tanh
  ]
