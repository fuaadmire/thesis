Good easy site and super service. The only drawback is they don't speak English
Can I ask you to check the comments field as well. Since you are not replying to mails and tickets, I would like to get a refund asap!!! You are fast in inisiting on your points that you are replying to tickets and mails. But matter of fact you do not even care a dime! You got my money but did not deliver anything! Still have not gotten feedback for any ticket I opened (not even received a ticket ID) for mails the same! I bought Battlefield 3 EU limited edition on CJS website. It was shown that the key will be in stock and can be retrieved instantly. My payment went smoothly, but the key is not delivered. When I tried to retrieve the key the website stated it is out of stock, with the informations still in the teaser that it is in stock? I think CJS fools people into buying the game key even if they do not have it. Leaves the impression that they finance themselfes with letting customers prepay for the games and when they have enough credit they buy it. (Should be the other way aorund, first build stock, then charge for what you can deliver). On facebook they put promises online that the keys will be delivered, every day postponing the delivery. Bought game on the 1st of Nov now on the 7th nothing delivered. On their website it is stated new keys arrived 31st of Oct, but matter of fact they did not receive the delivery. Great stuff! The trick in receiving an online key is for me that I can get the game instantly. Now I am waiting forever and could have bought the retail version and could already play for day's. Last time I ordered at CJS, worst experience ever.
I'm using Busuu for two years now and learned Spanish from scratch. It's free and the learning material is great. A big plus is the possibility to get corrected by native Spanish speakers around the world - and sometimes even become friends. Besides Spanish there are a lot of other languages that are taught on Busuu.
The selection of brands and variety is really good, I always find stuff that's not available in Germany and the service is nice and fast, that makes Urban Insdustry one of my favorite online shops!
I´ve ordered my game and one minute later I´ve got the key.
After waiting 4 months for our delivery (with a promised delivery of 3 weeks and the money already withdrawn from our account) i tried to call and write Myfab several times. The myfab customer service answering machine tells you to call in the opening hours, even if you are already calling in the opening hours! There is also no response on the order and support mail. It is not possible to cancel an order without contacting customer support.
If I want to know what's going on in the world I first search on twitter as it is the fastest source for news and changes.
I waited for about an hour or so before getting my key. But that's okay. Not instant like they said, but still very fast.
I have a cat and this small cleaning robot really makes a difference. It made my life easier.
I love wines and they have some of the finest ones which I order for some special occasions. Fast shipment,but also higher prices.
I have used toolani for a few years now. I like the technology a lot, the prices are not the best on the market, but bearing in mind the comfort of use, I would say they are quite acceptable. What really sucks is their customer service. Each time I had to contact it, I had horrible experience with them. Not helpful at all, not respectful, not even trying to be nice. I'm too lazy to actively look for an alternative at this point in time, however if I stumble across anything suitable, I will switch immediately. These guys haven't even tried to pretend that their clients are of any worth to them.
I like to order at ShytoBuy;  its simple to order and they deliver fast
After i ordered my games. In one hour i had my keys and then i finally can play with my friends online. Good deals and great support.
No problems to order the baby car seat we wanted. It was available and dispatched withing a couple of working days and delivered within three. I was kept up to date about my order via email. I ahve used PreciousLittleOne in the past and will do again in the future.
Eplphone dot arrived on time and unbelievable build quality . Can, t wait to get ripping
The service worked as promised and quick, so very pleased customer there. The only thing that worried me was the weird java applet demanding to get complete access to my computer's file system for file upload. Why not use a regular browser based upload function like everybody else does?
Our flight details where changing few times before our flight & every time we were notified per email. Just a great service! Will use it again!
In the beginning I felt a bit unease because the company seemend to be a bit shady (company name similar to a well-know big company, address somewhere in the suburbs of Paris). However everything went fine. Extremely fast delivery of the JR Pass voucher. It took just one day from Paris to Germany. Life-tracking via FedEx. The exchange of the voucher in the real pass in Japan was trouble-free. Note: Even though you have to state a starting date of the voucher on the day of purchase the exact starting date is specified on the date of exchange in Japan. So do not worry if you want to have it started at a different date than originally specified.
Our guide was Rachel we (mum and 2 teens) had a really enjoyable time, even though the weather wasn't great. The only criticsm - we thought the 45 minute break was far too long, maybe enjoyable in sunny weather but not so much fun when it's cold.
I like ebookers a lot. It gives me an overview over the cheapest flights in no time. I like it a lot that I can play around with days and times and will find the cheapest and most convenient flight in very short time. Initially, I was always back-checking with the respective airline that the flight would not be cheaper when buying directly with them. But it never was and now I don't do it anymore. The only thing which I find very annoying is the fact that there is a commission on paying with your credit card even though you have no other option than paying with your credit card. That is very very disappointing.
I really appreciate how fast the wares were delivered to me and i would definitely recommend macbethshop.com
ordered jammers, briefs and several goggles - just to try out different models, which one can easily afford at these prices. happy with everything, correct description, will order again (wrong size but my fault). delivery was not without an issue: it came to the billing address, not the delivery one. not sure how this can be improved as this is possibly on the Royal Mail, not the shop. Good thing they deliver with Royal Mail though!
the pick up was a Little bit comlicated but the staff was friendly (at least )
Flowers were great and packaged well.  The free delivery is a nice touch over other online florists..
I ordered three gloves from Germany and it took two weeks until they finally arrived. I wrote two emails but got no answers. So the article and the price were good, the delivery and communication definitely not!
I love the AutoKey function. Its easy to collect the game key and very cool to get they later from past orders. Keep up the good work!
I use google for every kind of information I'm looking for. If I'm looking for a new haircut or if I just want to know which movie I'm looking for, it doesn't matter because Google always helps me immediately. To tell the truth, I don't now if I could manage my life without google as I do it right now. :p
Booking made easy - I just wish you could still use PayPal.
The Service and the result is perfect and I would use it at any time.
I love this shop and their website backs up the great in-store service. They have a wide range of products, so it is the one place where I can find everything I need, from Clif bars to SIS gels. And also pick up a new pair of running shoes at the lowest prices.
They were quick to deliver and everything arrived as advertised. I didn't need to return anything but would be interested to know how well they handle returns
Adzuna makes job search simple. There are none of the annoying popups that are all over most of the other sites out there. Plus they have great stats showing average salary for your search which helps filter the results. It's definitely worth checking out
In short I called at 7:30 in the morning and had the van turn up at 9:30. The service was excellent and price was very reasonable, even for a same day service. I would definitely recommend Etyres to anyone.
I knew the product I wanted and found that Wicken had the best price and free delivery.  I ordered the product over the weekend and it was delivered by Tuesday. No complaints at all. I would recommend them to anyone.
I found it thought another search engine and all the process in the shopping was fine. I used Olotels to book a hotel in Paris with was a reasonable price for what are the prices there, although it was a bit far from the centre. Olotels lack a way to give opinions about the hotels, so I read opinions elsewhere, but it had the best price.
I booked a flight with airffasttickes, because it was the best price. And actually it worked...anyhow. But you get now informations about your flight numer or the check in, about changes of the flight or any other important notices. The Website is really bad organzied, and for me personally it was to  much stress to get the informations for a checkin So next time i will book with another company
It was the first time i bought a key from CJS-cdkeys and. The Price was very good but the anti-Fraud verification took a long time. So i sent the Anti-Fraud verification to them and 1 day later i got the confirmation that the anti-fraud was successful. Then i clicked on "Send the Key" and not 2 seconds later i had my key. So CJS gets 5 Stars from me and I'm glad to hear that i don't have to make the Anti-Fraud verification again :D
For the last 12 years I have been traveling to Europe yearly and just a few weeks ago, I again did the same. Almost exclusively I make my car rental arrangements through Auto Europe, who this time arranged my vehicle with Hertz car rental at the Frankfurt Airport. Never once have I been disappointed. Not only were the rental prices exceptionally competitive, but more importantly the service which I received, was always exceedingly respectful, courteous and very accommodating to satisfy my needs. Dr. J.J. P. Canada
Excellent service and courteous staff from start to finish. Will absolutely use this company again :-)
I used to book hotels through HRS via my Miles-and-More card account and have never been disappointed in any country, but in recent times, this no longers seems to work inside Indonesia where I am not frequently staying, at least depending on internet links. This time, for instance, HRS.Com worked (but not via Miles and More), including the booking, but I couldn't do it through my Miles account which made the process cumbersome and I do not usually want to spend so much time on it. Having completed the booking and received a confirmation, I contacted the hotel some hours later to ask if I could have a free airport transfer instead of the free transfer from the "railway station" offered by the HRS booking confirmation. The hotel advised that they did not have my booking, even after I sent the  booking reference number and all the details, and in any case, they refused to provide a free transfer. I took several emails to clarify the matter (I eventually emailed them my HRS confirmation), but they still refused a gratis transfer, and I will definitely not book this hotel again.
easy to buy from webside. The body part was as expected good. The delivery was very fast  I would warmly recommend others to shop here.
Bought my first game there one week ago. I chose this shop because of the low price. Delivery was made within 1 hour. I would buy again at this shop
Multilingual website so no ordering problems! Confidence inspiring questions about delivery details. Good communication upon receipt of order. Flowers arrived at the time required and instructions regarding pr-phone call were followed. The flowers were of high quality and delivered to a very happy lady celebrating her 30th Birthday! Many thanks!!!
I wanted to sell my tickets, because I wasn't able to attend the concert. So, I was really happy to come across this site, only to be cheated at the end. I followed the instructions, get the tickets in an envolope, meet with the UPS guy and send them as instructed. The concert was unfortunatelly canceled, which is bad luck for the guy who gut the tickets (but could still get the money back). However, I did my part but so far I haven't recieved any money and it's been more then a month since the concert took place. There user service is terrible, I wrote them three emails, of which two were ignored and one replied: We are dealing with your situation. That was it. Stay away if you can!
Got my spares in no time at a really good price so very happy.
at the first glance i had mixed feelings by using this site because the booking process seemed to be confusing me. Especially I missed more usable confirmation questions and icons during booking and paying-processes, this was not a good experience for me.  But in the end everything was working satisfying.
The envelopes came very fast and were worth the price.
What shall I write more then the stuff I did so far? It covers everything so far with nice price, fast delivery, always willing to buy something again ;-)
I was in spain in vacation and the battery of my camera was always very fast empty. I asked google for a supplier of that battery and i was surprised that there was a supplier with a good price for the battery and with no shipping cost. So thats the reason for my order. The battery is delivered in a envelope and it is running very long, good item.
I rather prefer to pay a bit more with other companyes, than being treated as animals. We were TWO persons traveling just with ONE case and they asked us to pay extra money because the bag was 0'5 cms wider!!!!! There are rules and they did't accept any logic!! Never again!!!
Even though the online store does not live up to the "real" store in Florence :-)  it is a great alternative if you do not live or travel to Florence. What I love about the store most besides the great selection is the fact of free worldwide delivery. So it is actally chaeaper for me to order from Italy rather than from Germany (where I live) since most of the German based online stores often charge up to 10 Euros for the delivery - even if you buy a dress for 1000 Euros! Products featured  where always as described and in perfect condition when they arrived in a picture perfect wrapping. If somehthing does not fit it is easy to return it and get the money back. I will for sure order again.
I ordered an Elica Shell for my kitchen in Juli since - according to the customer service agent I spoke to - it  was on stock and ready to be delivered. After 2 weeks I called customer service again  to find out that this item generelly has a delivery time of two weeks but that it was not currently available at all but will be back on stock in SEPTEMBER! Of course my money + delivery charges of over 200 Euro(!!!)  where taken at the day I ordered. I wrote an e-Mail to the manager and told him that I am not a bank who does the financing of the company but a customer who is expecting the ordered items. No answer so far (and this is also over a week ago). So sorry, but I can not rcommend this company. Still today - even though the mangement and the custoemr service agents know the product will not be available before September - the internet page still claims a delivery time of 10-14 daysfor this item. So they are simplyand knowingly betraying the customers... After the order was delayed several times I wrote an e-Mail on October 8th to cancel the order. Today I called since no money was yet transfered and I was told that the cancellation was not received and that it can take up to 30 (!!!) days till I get my money back. I will contact paypal right now to open up a case against this company and I will also call the producer of the hood to inform them about this. The customer service is a joke! Since I payed with paypal I thought I would have full consumer protection. Unfortunately this is only valid for 45 days and due to all the delays the 45 days have already expired. I called paypal and they will still try to contact and solve the problem and will have the seller under observation for their next transactions. I guess this is the most I can do for other consumers trying to buy from this company. I will now contact Amex and my lawyer to finally get my money back. Stay tuned...
I read dozens of bad reviews about this company and was - to be honest - afraid to use their service. After all, a lot of money could be lost. I have no clue where the terrible ratings come from but I had no problems with viabox (formerly Viaddress)! In fact, their service is great! The website is easy to use, the rates are cheap and they are really fast. They updated my incoming mail in just a few hours and shipped my items on the next business day. I ordered some glass items too and combined two orders. They were re-packed really well and a lot of packing material was used to make sure nothing breaks - and nothing did (shipping to Europe via FedEx). I'm going to be using their services again in the future and I can really recommend them.
We liked the idea of offering people the opportunity to stay with families and have contact to native speakers.
We had a lot of fun in New York. We did between 3 to 4 attraction every day during 7 days. I did not calculate what we saved, but watching the individual prices makes you feel good that you paid less. In my view the offers were of high quality: nice botanic gardens, guided walking tours, etc. However, as well some critical points. The map with the numbers are not in the right order. You have an attraction 35 next to 54 which is bad when you have to turn the pages. When you start planning your daily trips like this in New York, you lose too much time. Most numbers are geographically close to each other but totally messed up in chronologic order. A couple of events were closed or did not except the New York Pass although they were in the book. A pitty when you did a long trip to see the museum. Several events (sailing) have to be pre-ordered by phone various days in advance and they asked for a credit card via phone with the three digit secret number (not very serious - someone purchased something with my credit card - I had to block the card). The three digit code on the backside of my credit card was given away by the concierge of our Carlton hotel when booking the sailing activity in the NY Pass. Although, we had various small disappointing things to bear like discribed, it was good value for money and we would recommand the purchase of the card to other tourists.
Do not use this company for your flight tickets. Just like a lot of reviews here, my credit card was "denied". I called Diners who could inform me that they had used a wrong security code. A code that was nowhere near the correct code. Travelgenio sent me several mails stating that my credit card had been denied, and should I choose to cancel, I would still have to pay any fees and insurance I had ordered. Ater writing them 5 emails and trying to call with no luck, I received an email with a link for their "trusted secure payment gateway". Here they only accepted Visa and Mastercard, and there was an additional fee which increased the ticket price by 20%. Again I wrote them emails telling them that the increase in the price was unacceptable etc. Finally they cancelled the purchase. It's going to be interesting to see if they're still able to deduct the fees from the "denied" credit card. Reading all the reviews here it seems this is their way of working!
It's perfect if you want to buy cheap, but if you plan to sell your stuff it's a rip-off. You have to pay enormous fees and if you offer PayPal (what is necessary for the first 50 ratings) they take fees for PayPal, too.
On my booking confirmation: I see the confirmation number, I see the car, I see the passengers, I even see the langth of my car! But I don't see the destination nor the day of travel nor the departure time nor the arrival time nor the name of the vessel nor the port of departure SO GUESS
Used them regularly in the beginning (about 10 years ago now). It was a cheap way to get around and the hassle was outweight by the price. By now the flights are usually not much cheaper than elsewhere, but the hassle gets more and more. Can't be bothered anymore, I'd rather pay a bit more and have the "luxury" of knowing my seat beforehand and not having to pay extra for luggage, booking or anything else... You get what you pay for... not really... you pay a lot and get next to nothing.
I fly BA on a regular basis (usually European flights between UK and Germany) and haven't had a bad experience with them. So we decided to book our honeymoon with them as well. Not just flight, but package with flight and hotel. Good a great deal for 11 nights New York in a brilliant central hotel. Well done.
I love the Ann Harvey fashion and am a regular user of their website. Never been any issue with it. Only thing I really miss is the flagship store in London which unfortunately closed down last year. Such a shame.
I love that you have so many payment options, with such a wide range of games available. I can defiantly recomend this to my friends and practically anyone I run into. This site I will be using again very soon. Thank you for good support and fast delivery! Martin S. Andersen nitram166@gmail.com
I shopped around to find the most economic way to play "Bioshock Infinite - Burial at Sea". Saw an offer on Green Man Gaming, bought it and it worked flawlessly in Steam :) No hassle at checkout, no waiting on the key -- it was right there after checkout in my email -- and most of all: no steam complaints when registering my key. This is how it should be!
I was helped at all stages of the signup..The money transfer was quick and efficient, the exchange rate excellent!
Unfortunately, I only read the reviews about this company after I had already placed my order. Big mistake! At first everything seemed to work fine. I placed my order, got a conformation email, my bank account was charged, got another email with a tracking number. But since the nothing has happened. And the mail should have been arrived 2 days ago, since they said it would take a maximum of 12 days to ship it. But according to the tracking number it's still at the airport in Germany (since 2 weeks now!). And when I tried to contact them, I only got an automated email reply saying someone will contact me within 24h to solve my problem, but nothing happened. It seems they just put emails right into the spam folder.  I'm very upset and disappointed cause it was supposed to be a Valentine's present. If nothing has happened til Friday, I will call the bank to get my money back and I'm thinking about taking legal actions, cause this is clearly a criminal company with only one goal. And that is to exploit people! So better choose another website to order from!
More than a year ago I posted a review criticizing the bad support of OKS but in this time there has been changed a lot. I placed my first order in September 2010 and since then I ordered keys (for me, friends etc.) worth more than 1800€. So I think you can say I am an often returning customer to OKS ;) Indeed it is true: the support was horrible a year ago. You had to wait several days to receive an answer, it was annoying as hell. But now issues are solved in only a few hours. In fact I didn't have to contact the support in the last half of a year at all. So a big thumb up, you're doing a great job. PS: Your Facebook discount code isn't valid anymore :P
Nice Currency Converter, i like the currency performance and investment calculator
Your advice and ebookers tips by email are very informative. Also for future flight and hotel accommodation bookings.
Great place for online shopping. Great prices and prompt delivery, not to mention great quality of products.
A must visit website for chocolate lovers. Yummy products, no hassle shopping and prompt delivery.
Good portal with a little bit about everything. I like yahoo's mail service and messenger.
I order from them all the time, they have some fantastic skin-care products. Recommended.
The rental process was very good and fast. A booking over internet before holidays can be suggested because  the payment is also managed very comfortable. I can suggest this company and cooperation for booking cars in USA.
Will definitely buy again from them soon. Their services and customer support are the best I have ever had the pleasure to encounter. Prompt, professional and having the best prices makes them the ideal shopping place for all your IT&C needs.
I have been a happy customer of StrongVPN for the past 2 years. In that time, I had to resolve one login issue that was fixed in almost no time through the live chat. As far as setup goes, it couldn't be easier: the dashboard provides all login information on one glance, and you can even download a free tool that will set up StrongVPN on your machine. For anyone wanting to stay in charge, it's easy as pie to fill in the login details via the Windows VPN setup. Connection speed and reliability haven't disappointed a single time, and I just renewed for another 12 months. Check them out, it's worth it.
The Webshop offers very good serach Tools and contains nearly everything which has to do with batteries! The products are like the originals but for a much lower Price. The delivery was very fast, within a few days. I fully recommend this  shop!
The service was really good it was next day delivery and everything arrived in good condition.
I purchased a product and few seconds later the key was already in my inbox. Very fast and  also good  Live service.  Keep going
It's been a long time that i'm buying from Hobbyfly and i have to admit that they have the best shipping and service that i've ever seen.you will always get your order in the expected time...!
I like to buy one here for the following reasons: 1. Many good American liquids or flavors you get without having any problems with the German customs. 2. The product is usually very inexpensive, especially the deals in large packs. 3. The delivery usually works very quickly and reliably.
This was my first experience of booking tickets online with trainline. When I got to the last page, something went wrong and a message appeared in red letters for a short time. I assumed that meant my booking hadn't worked, so I started again and had better luck the second time. However, when I checked my account I saw that both bookings had worked and I now had two "Advance, non-refundable" tickets, opne to be collected at Canterbury East and the other at Canterbury West! I sent an e-mail explaining what had happened but not really expecting a positive answer and had pictured myself travelling from east bto west to collect both my tickets and then standing in the early morning queue trying to sell one of them. Well, in a matter of hours I had an e-mail back saying that my refund request had been processed successfully and that a refund was on the way. I was absolutely delighted. Many thanks to trainline for their sympathetic and unbureaucratic handling of my request. I should point out that this all happened in a matter of hours on Whitsunday! I daren't criticize the website for what happened in the first place, it doesn't seem to happen to many people and it worked perfectly OK the second time, but...does anyone know what happened? It was the page at the end where you are asked to fill in a form. Many thanks again. Chris
It's always a pleasure to shop at boxfresh.co.uk. Their shoes are amazing and so is their service. Even if you're not living in the UK (I'm ordering from Germany), they are fast, comparable cheap and have outstanding service. 5 stars.
I always got my keys really fast. Its cheap and secure.
I have always had excellent experiences with Hostelworld and they have so far never let me down. It is a great way of organizing your trip and accommodation.
Excellent shopping site, came so quick well packed & excellent prices will def buy again !!!
We enjoyed our trip to New York and the New York Pass is a very good idea for the first visit. We saw a lot of attractions in this awesome city.
Hostelworld is a great place to find the perfect accommodation for your needs - and your budget. We have used it three times so far, and each stay was a success.
Thank You very much for this good Work , very afraid how fast and very good Conversation, fast Shipment ,Thanks !
Taking 30 Euros for cancellation promised as free of charge and deleting comments on facebook mentioning that!? Not a fair attitude!!! Referring to the feedback by Autoescape - mentioning on a facebook fanpage that they advertise on the German version of their page with free-of-charge cancellation (not the reality in the end as I had to pay 30 Euros) and telling them then on the facebook page that this is not working is in my world not inappropriate! Check the facebook page out - there are NO other comments than nice ones - this is window dressing at its best and not showing the truth at all. Thanks god trustpilot is nothing they can control! ;-) Maybe they should spend more money in the customer service as on deleting and answering complaints!
In Germany it is really hard to watch stuff from the states and a lot of youtube videos are restricted and can't be seen from a german IP. Hulu and other sites aren't even possible to use. So Hide my Ass! is the perfect solution for every european to watch EVERYTHING HE WANTS. I love it, use it every day and can recommend it everybody!
Country Attire is a very reliable retailer. The products are well chosen and of very good to excellent quality that are worth the price. Delivery is very quick - even to a place in the German countryside. You won´t be disappointed!
I buy all my games on Kinguin, since there website showed up on the net! They never disappointed me and i had never any problems with one of their keys or gift items. Support is really great, nice and friendly people who will always help you with every question you might have. But the best is, you will find all the games you want for the very best price!!! So, i highly recommend it, cheers ;-)
I ordered binoculars from Foto Erhardt and I do not have any complaints. Order process was simple, email confirmations very informative and the delivery fast. Can only recommend.
Delivery took a while and the canvas wasn't very tight fixed but the picture quality is good.
I bought a game for Steam (Space Engineer) and it took them about 5 seconds to deliver the game key. I am absolutely happy with the service.
I received a follow-up email about my stay and filled out Hotels.com review of my hotel stay at Hacienda Real by Encanto. Unfortunately my review was not posted. My email to hotels.com: I booked a hotel in Playa del Carmen though Hotels.com for 11 days and was very dissatisfied with it. I received your email asking me to review hotel, which I took time to do. Review is not showing up. Why would my review not show, because it was not good enough!? I wish I had been warned that this hotel was nothing like described. And now it is appearing like hotels.com only puts favourable or semi-favourable reviews. I would appreciate a response as to why my comments were not posted on my bad stay. Until now I’ve got no answer from hotels.com…
I always have trouble to see what the cancelation policy is and if the hotel will charge my credit card with what amount already at booking or not. this can be improved.
The delivery man was very rude. He made me come downstairs claiming that one parcel was to heavy to carry it alone. It turned out he just didn't want to walk the stairs twice. I told him I am paying Argos for delivery to the flat and that I cannot walk the stairs well. He said I am behaving like this because he is black, and called me a racist. He threatened to take back all boxes if I would not apologize, literally grabbing them from outside my door and leaving. I had spent the whole day waiting for this delivery, unable to go to work, so I did my best to calm him down. When I finally had my parcels inside, I asked for his name before signing and he refused to give it to me, again threatening to take back all parcels (i.e. entering my home to take them). I have never experienced such a delivery service. I am honestly shocked and scared.
Ordering and delivery went extraordinarily smooth, which meant a lot for us as this was the first furniture to arrive at our new place =) We are very happy with our bean bag products. One minor issue is that one of the cotton bags was damaged when arriving and the small white balls spread out in the living room. Its now all stuffed into a sofa bed but I'm wondering whether it affects the quality. And I don't dare opening the zipper any more...
as I have wished for great handling and top product
Well i don't know what to write here. I just bought a serial from this page. It was a scanned retail box.
Bought and preordered serveral games here, starting in 2009 and never had any problems that couldn't be solved. Wanted to cancel a preordered game and got my money back in 24hrs or so. Also I once received a wrong keycode but after talking to the support staff they sent me a working code instantly. +++rep greetz
Wow, what a service. I am impressed by the fast handling in store and the overnight shipping to Germany. Mounting of the skis + packaging was perfect. Competitive Prices. Edge & Wax is definitely a recommendation!
It is always fun to shop with you as the service is extraordinarily fast and friendly and your products are the best! Many thanks from Germany!
I saw a film about Glencoe in German TV. It was deeply impressing  and I remembered our yourney through Scottland some years ago. So I decided to become a part of people who are helping to save this wonderful landscape. Getting a title by the way isn't so bad. Now my wife and I are proud to be owners of a piece of land in Scottland and of course having the title "Lord" and "Lady". Besides: Who doesn't know the song of the Scottish band "Gaberlunzie": " Massacre of Glencoe"? So we can recommend this project by full heart! Bye
I've bought some Games at this shop and have no Problems at any Time! When you want a cheap key you can buy a RUS/Polish or any other Version from this site with a bit work they are  adequate Versions! TOP Site next Game i supposedly buy here!
Another company with the credo: get the customer's money without offering helpful service. Germany has the reputation of really bad customer service so I guess Zavvi is a German company... Let me tell you my story (it happened 1 or 2 years ago - I don't want to remember) in a few words: I ordered an item as regular customer from Germany. I tried to cancel the order, it was not possible due to unknows reasons (ready to ship said the customer service) A few days later the order ships - A FEW DAYS LATER! Item arrived,  I contacted the service to send it back. I waited a day. I waited another day. And another day, too. I finally got an answer with instructions, I sent the item back from GER to UK. It's not cheap. I eventually had to remember them for the refund. I would be waiting until today if I didn't tell them. I claimed the additional shipping costs as it was not my fault that zavvi wasn't able to cancel their item DAYS BEFORE SHIPMENT. The customer bots were not helpful at all, I really tried to be reasonable. I got the same stupid answer from each operator. They always name themselves with an different first name in each of their answers. As I can't sue them from GER and the amount was not THAT high - I gave in. They prefer losing a regular customer to save 5 EUR. Well, let me tell you: it's not the way to make money... not in GER and not in UK. But let me tell you another thing: It's my choice where I order. And it won't be Zavvi again - in my lifetime - for sure. They were even too dumb to unsubcribe me from their newsletter. One of their bots promised me to do so. He wasn't able to... Okay, you will say now: click the link in the newsletter and it will be done. I did - and encountered technical issues from their site. Again and again. To get rid of that annoying newsletter I had to send it back to their service-email and insult them. After some time it worked. Before I left I asked them to delete my account. They did that – fast & perfect!  . So, the lesson here is: buy, if you know what you want and calculate some money loss as well. If you E-V-E-R have a problem... yeah, well, you will die with it. So, I stick with theirs rivals like Amazon; they’re not always the cheapest but their service is stellar and a blink in the dark. Remember my words. You have been warned!
The Original! The monthly humblebundle plus the weekly sales are amazing and a great opportunity to raise your games library! You can also pay via Amazon if you like. Recently including a shop with changing offers. Highly recommended!
Fantastic site if you're looking for great games and cheap prices. It's a Brazilian site and actually only for Brazilians/South Americans. But there is always a way to buy there nevertheless. :-)
Ordered one big Blu-ray Box from them with Destination Germany. The shipment surely took awhile but eventually it arrived. And as lucky as I am I didn't have to pay additional taxes....Great!
Stop searching for the world's best retailer, you found it! Good pricing, fast and easy to manage website, splendid customer service and never one fail in 14 years! As I live in Germany receiving the shipments takes a while. Out of hundreds of orders since then only one box got lost - Amazon instantly refunded the price. They even phone you in Germany if you want. It's a pleasure ordering from them!
They lure you into buying games without giving proper informations about versions, keys, third-party-drm. As an example: If you're buying a (steam-)game that is censored in germany you will receive a censored steam key - and the point is: you're buying in UK or US. They don't tell you about that fact and the customer service is of no help at all. They play dead and even when you get an answer, it's a dumb one. Nobody is really willing to help. So if you're brainlessly buying games you are at the right place there but beware if you encounter problems. Nobody will help you and your money is gone.... German customer dealing has the reputation of being really really bad and partly it's correct but the UK customer service is as bad as the german one. See Zavvi, they're hustlers as well. These companies save every penny at the risk of losing customers. Listen: WELL DONE! I will surely buy elsewhere in future and I have no problem doing so. You wanted it that way.
I ordered and paid in advance at this store. Luckily enough with paypal, so I can claim my money back. Apart from automatic replies I got nothing from this store - neither the items ordered nor any reply by email. So I think this might be the case of an automated web store where its owner is maybe out of business / ill or whatever and the webstore is till working? DO NOT  BUY THERE, you will waste your money.
always friendly and helpful! we love to buy at country attire !!!!
It was my second order and again it was processed very fast and perfectly packaged - nothing to grumble about. I´m going to test (ride) my new MTB-gloves tomorrow on a rainy sunday in the Grunewald-Forest. :-)
The news are up to date, the service is the fastest if ever had and the prices are the lowest if ever seen.
This is my first time using Easyto book and I am very surprised at how convenient it was to book a hotel room. Prices of the hotels are straightforward, one knows exactly what one has to pay including taxes etc.  The best thing is there is no booking fees. I would definitely use this site again but first we have to see how the checking in goes at the hotel in New York in February, using our reservation from Easytobook.
Ordering was quick and easy, a free shaker was included and the delivery to Germany took three days. Fair price, perfect service.
Easy booking of faries, as no hassle with it. Only bad point is that this time there was no special price (more expensive) so it is almost the same then when traveling with the Eurotunnel.
Everything costs extra at easyjet. The price you see on their website is no where near the price you end up paying.
G2A.com is like ebay but it 100% better i Love this Company! The Marketplace is great you can sell your keys perfectly. When I have a problem i write a mail or join the 24/7 Live Support and they help my immediately.
New car in a good condition. Good service at pick up and at car return.
Nice shop, nice employees and very fast shipping. Thanks I would buy there again.
Wrote to ask about what was needed, got a helpful reply, and then ordered what was needed. This was delivered on the day required. All quite painless, unlike my foot. Not entirely sure I have the right thing, but that would be down to me, not PhysioRoom!
Hello, by chance i have found WorldRemit to send money from Austria in Europe to the Philippines, where the family of my wife is living. A long time i was using a very expensive Union, that company refused to take me as an online customer, even  without giving any reason for doing so, so i had to pay a lot for every sending. Now i have found the right one ! Again and again it works fine, the receiver immediately gets SMS and can fetch the money. And : Really cheap and reliable ! Even from time to time, there is an offer to send money without any fee. Can only say : Thank you !
I ordered some EVE TIME CODES some months ago and the order was processed very fast and all keys worked great. Very good shop!
This year you weren`t able to deliver the flowers on time .It was a specially anniversary and the delivering on that special date was very important for us. But nontheless the recipient was later surpriced about the wonderful flowers. We hope it will work better next year.
Available at any time of the week, very helpful and patient staff!
I always use this site now for several ferry crossing every year, and from different countries. This website has so far never let me down. It is quick, blessedly simple, and most importantly relaible.
we booked on prijsvrij in the Netherlands and found nice service, good quality and good pricing... strong recommend!
I ve ordered a couple of times @ sportsdirect and its right they have very cheap prices and deliver very fast even out of England (+1euro!) Can't say anything about customer service - no need yet I always recoeved the right size, color etc... good prices hell yes
I bought games at OKS because they are cheap, safe and fast in delivery. I love OKS. So i hope OKS will never get down.
I was looking for a translation office in Frankfurt to tranlate an insurance broker contract with 6 pages. Calls I have made had same information actually. 2 Euro per line and it should take up to a week to receive the translation. Straker has a superb technical platform where you can upload the sheets that are supposed to be translated. Within moments you receive a quote with the final fee. You can choose between different possibilities how fast you want to receive your translation. Once you gave permission to translate you receive an information at what time the translation will be delivered by mail. The translation itself was made in a professional manner with no mistakes and the fee cheaper than all ther others offices. One thing though was a little confusing. When I was placing an additional job, which can be made in your own Straker account, the fee was in US-Dollar and not in Euro. I couldnt find a button to change that. At the bottom line...I will use Straker again !
Looked for a intercontinental flight at [external reference] and found the supposedly  cheapest one with travelgenio. But considering the charged fees of more than 100 euros travelgenio is not the cheapest anymore. So be careful before you finally press the buy-button. Also, on your bill there´s no separation of flight price and fees. You can only see one amount being charged. That´s not transparent and considering the high fees it´s quite clear why they don´t want to have transparency. Can´t recommend this agency.
The survey was done in the timeframe I wanted and was very thorough. The report covered lots of small things that should be part of regular maintenance but tend to get left when you actually live in a property. So  when I've moved in I intend to use the report to slowly pick up on what needs doing. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the lack of an estimate of rebuild costs. To be fair, I said I didn't need an estimate of value but I didn't realise at the time, as I didn't need a mortgage, I would need that to get estimates for insurance purposes. A bit more guidance on that aspect would have been helpful. Except for that one point, I'm very happy with the service Miller Metcalfe provided.
I'm using this website to share my own music. This allows me to share ideas with other artist and they constatly give me feedback and critize my music so that I just can take a profit out of it. So in the end of the day I can guarantee you, that this  website is more than just an music sharing portal. It helps me from day to day to get better in what I love to do: Producing Music.
I'm seriously upset about how my order turned out. The next day delivery took place as expected. But that was the only thing that turned out as advertised. The Bouquet of flowers had nothing in common with the Bouquet I ordered. These were Birthday flowers for my daughter . I feel so dissapointed that It wasn't possible to have sent a nice looking Bouquet of flowers on my daughters Birthday. The next one is a year away. This delivery was not worth the money I had to pay. I think that it is abusive and betraying to your customers to use whatever and how many flowers as you wish. After all we have to pay for these Services with real money and ahead of delivery.
The BagStore is a reliable and professional weshop, I can only recommend it. My bag was nicely packed, I received it quickly and had the pleasure to find a handwritten note in the package.
A great piece of software that leaves no wishes unfulfilled. Led by a great team with great support. Keep it up!
I buy everytime by myprotein.de and it is perfect! I am from german and within 3days my packet is at my house and the price is very cheap and the quality is very good! Next time again, myprotein.de
Excellent booking site, totally cumtom-tailored, i.e. mapping of hotels on a map, providing additional informations like pictures, customer reviews etc, distances to sought after areas and places of interest --> this makes it easier for you to narrow down the hotel findings. Also a big benefit: Possibility of a free of charge booking cancellation ( sometimes it happens that itineraries change because of circumstances that you are not responsible for ( flight cancellation by the airline, etc. ) and also best price guarantee --> no need to look on other sites and if it happens that you spot the same hotel on another site for a lower price then you get the difference back. The variety offered here is also one of the best. There is a lot more positive to say. Areas of improvement: Within the review area it would be nice to have a functionality that allows to group the reviews by language and to translate the comments from one to another language. This would help to speed up the decision process. Thank you very much Booking.com team for working hard to offer such an excellent site that focus on the real customer needs.
I was 100% satisfied with the delivered products and customer service.
I buy a game key and the game key comes in 8 minutes verry fast and nice 100% nice and 5 stars
the skin came in no time, properly wrapped and  just what I had wanted
Aber was ich bis jetzt gesehen habe , finde ich gut .
Well, I've been a loyal alpharooms customer for years now. So far my travel arrangements with alpharooms have been very positive. Most the time the prices for my desired hotels have been slightly better than anywhere else, which made me choose alpharooms. Their booking procedure is easy, paying with my credit card has been nothing but simple. All vouchers were send in time and checking in around the world has been a piece of cake so far. Two little things that bug me nonetheless: The separate credit card fee is rubbish. I mean what the cuss? Alpharooms punishes me for using my credit card? No-go! Number two is my impression that recently hotel prices gone up the roof. I checked several hotel prices for upcoming trips to the US and Asia, but other well-known travel-sites simply offered the same accommodations for way less money. I will keep an eye on that...
Onlinekeystore.com has low prices, a great set of products and a nice and fast support. I would recommend this one to everyone willing to buy game keys online!
I purchase Skyrim from CJS-CDKeys and everything worked fine. It took a little while until I got my key, but not too long.
I bought Battlefield 4 (RUS) here ,because nowhere else it was so cheap as here. It was the Russian version but it was simple to patch to english with the intruction from OKS. I already bought GTA IV and a DLC for Black Ops 2 here and i got it both after only a few minutes. This Shop is amazing for the top games and the prices are mostly cheaper then anywhere else.
The perfect  Barbour quality plus a delivery time from the UK to Germany in 48 hours
I have been buying games from Greenmangaming.com for the past 2 years and thus far, every purchase has been hassle-free (Though the occasional late key delivery does happen due to the publishers) and the prices have been splendid. Just bought Titanfall for 45 bucks last week so thank you for your great service thus far GMG :D ~ Ninjaman999
I've bought sometimes from nelly.com. But there were always problems. To late deliveries, damaged goods (e. g. shoes), a bad support when something went wrong and last but not least i've problems and it took a loooot time to get my money bag, when I've returned something of my order. So, I won't order anything else from nelly.com & I won't recommend that page.
cheap delicious whey a lot of information for beginners very good = )
I am a Canadian living in Germany and was looking for some food closer to what we had at home which they certainly had. The shipping was reasonable and fast I fully recommend giving them a try.
The site is easy to use, you can trust that the prices stated are the cheapest. Even checked with the company own sites, the prices are the same.
Wide range and special products - I've found exactly what suits me! I like this!
It was a pleasure to order the items and have such a fast feedback!. The quality of the items was as expected and the shipping was absolut fast. So that I recommend: whenever I buy furniture like this, I will try to have it from  this supllier.
This was the first time that I have used an internet service for flower delivery and after looking at various choices I decided that Euroflorist offered everything I was looking for: a) a wide choice of flower arrangements offered at different price levels to suit all occasions, b) a fast delivery service which is under their own control c) options for gift cards etc. and d) a variety of payment methods. The flowers were delivered on time and arranged very nicely and I can certainly recommend this service to anyone needing to send flowers reliably.
Ok at was indeed a technical defect but the shop staff could hand over my CD keys very quickly and that is really nice
OKS is awesome.. I only buy my gamecodes there! They've got the cheapest prices and the special offers are every day.. every week really great! You can pay with all methods and the key is in your account in 1-10 minutes! Thanks OKS !
Over the last few months I have ordered numerous items from SDS on line. They have all arrived within a couple of days, from placing the order, and on date and time SDS advise. The items are all of superb quality, and of rugged / solid construction and are as described and shown, which sometimes is not always the case from other suppliers. The prices are very competive for the quality. If you are looking for the big to the small SDS has it all.
I saw what we wanted on the internet, was not pressurised at the shop something I hate, bought the item the sales man explained everything to me, I got confirmation of delivery, i got timed delivery slot, on the day I got a call from the driver half an hour before he arrived, and he arrived on time. Which is fantastic. He and his partner took the item were it was wanted which is excellent. When I unpacked it, it was perfect gave it a coat of bees wax as told, and it looks brillant.
flipkey is a fine serivce to learn about fine locations to a reasonable price. Some times it is hard to find a good place to stay and the booking process could better. As an asumtion it is good service with slightly aprovements to be made.. Prices in euro, more places to stay. better booking process.
nothing much to say, delivery, information and product as advertised, value for money satisfactory = no complaints, happy camper.....
Good guys are working for that project. I like their cases and they are very complaisant.
I'm trading there since february and have never been dissapointed. Although there were some minor problems they always knew how to help and solve it very fast.
I had ordered some Item without any bigger expectations, but it was verry good and also just in shipping time. Thanks to SuntecStore
no issues at all and good service without any problems
Too bad verification can only be done by Facebook. That has to be changed!!!
There was no real problem to make reservation. The only small irritation was on filling in my phone number. you did not accept the correct writing vor the state number 0049 for germany i had to write +49 which is correct but not generally used in germany.
I was in the middle of  a booking process at another booking website when Easytobook poped up in a side window offering cheaper prices for the same hotel I was about to book. The booking process was fast and could be completed with not too many clicks. Vital information was given correctly and well placed so I did not have to search for cost items and what the booking included and what was not included. Confirmation email came swiftly after booking and upon arrival to my hotel also my special requests had already been registered and organized by the hotel. Great experience - Easy in all aspects and it worked out perfectly!
I bought an AMD Radeon HD 6870 GPU. It was so cheap (114€), that I first thought that I have been cheated or something after reading some of the ratings on here. The product arrived as fast as it was possible, for it had to be shipped from France to Germany, it took about 4-5 days. The package was well secured, for GPUs are usually quite sensitive, so that was alright. It even was a GPU made by Sapphire, one of the biggest producers of grafic cards in the world. I was suspicious at first, because it seemed impossible that a product this cheap could come from a well known company. However, the shop loses one star because of the high shipping costs (~10€) and the high fee for cash on delivery (~10€)
All of a sudden every bank transfer is routed via the US, so you will have to pay another 10-20 $ PLUS the entropay fees. If you want to close the account the customer support proves incapable of refunding your money remaining on the account. If you want to use it for spotify or other services: They block entropay credit cards. So its useless. DONT use it.
I ordered the first time from gamekool, and after wondering, why they don't have my card in stock, i searched the internet and thought I had been scammed. But after now 14 (working-)days I recieved my order along with a little gift for the delay. All in all, gamekool has good prices, a great email support(they always replied within 24h), and, regarding the free shipping, a normal delivery time.
--dealextreme-- i ordered several times, mostly batteries and electonic repair stuff. always recieved my order within the time you have to expect for FREE shipping from asia. always well packed, never any custom problems. you have to watch what you buy, but overall, the best asian shop i know.
My query and booking was dealt with in a quick, kind and professional manner.
My father and I are very happy with the flower quality and service. Thank you so much.
I'm super happy with TheHut! Their prices are the best and they ship very fast. I strongly recommend them!
Great prices and service. Shipping time and cost not ideal to Australia though
Where should i start? Well first of all OnlineKeyStore.com is in nearby every list one of the cheapest Keystore. When i was first concerned if everything is legal and trustful they showed me with their friendly and fast support that they really listen to their customers and  always trying to improve their shop. Moreover they got epic discounts on some games so that you just must buy them. To sum it up OnlineKeyStore.com is one of the best if not the best Online Key shop in the internet and you should definitly try them out for yourself!
Well first of all i was really shocked when i read all the bad reviews about them and i try to conract them serveral times to ask them if there is still everything ok with my booking. To be fair i have to say it worked everything out for me. i was listed with the airline i´ve booked and i got my two flights. The only problem is their policy they have and it is very hard to reach them. all in all i can´t say anything bad about them but would recommend to other people "rather pay 100 or 50 Euro more and book through a traveloffice or direct through the airline.It was kind of an adventure to find out if i get my flight or not. And i would also recommand other people read the reviews first before you book through onlinetravelagents (which i did not eigther) travelgenio has not really a good customerservice
My experience has been great with B&H. There are one or two other companies that I deal with from time to time but the best deals and offers have always come from B&H. And no other company has ever offered my cash rewards either. When I called about a problem I had with some equipment that I bought the person was very professional and knowledgeable. Had the problem solved in a minute. Thumps up.
everthing was good, there answer the questions fast and after the order - zhe shoes came 4 days later to germany
I ordered at 7th of december at fommy.co.uk. It was a item, which, at the moment of ordering (and paying thru paypal!) was in stock (green), even the day after, it remained "green". I expected to get the item before xmas, it was time enough, even for delivery to germany. The tracking told me, that the item was in "transit" so i hoped the best. 15 days later i asked per eMail about the delivery. No response until now. Same status. I called the customer service and they told me it was temp. out of stock and would be sent at december 28th. If that was right, the online status of today (29th) should tell me something different, but it's still "transit". The online-chat told me, that they expect delivery on January 4th. I have no hope in that anymore. [-] no reply to emails [-] non specific online tracking [-] no information about delays [-] listing items as in-stock, which are not [+] online chat They should go to the amazon-school, that company knows, how to act.
The negative: __________________________________ I'm a gamer, so I don't want to be interrupted, nor I want a program that has features I already installed. I do program updated myself, but first I need to click through many options, to disable the software checker. One simple notification (no popup, just some text on the main menu) whould be enough. Also Avast should mute itself, whenever a program is in fullscreen mode to not interrupt the user. One thing i hate about the new Avast is the Windows 8 like design. It just looks like it is for little kids to play with. The older design was well done and it suits Avast more than the "happy smiling happy face thing". I don't like the idea of Avast as my firewall, because I think that there will be problems with regular updates. Avast is an anti-virus software, no Firewall. (Also I'm a little bit angry about Zonealarm for integrating an annoying anti-virus sometimes conflicting with Avast) If you have big problems with a very strong virus; Avast can't find it on the harddrive (at least mine couldn't). So you may need the Removal Tool by Kaspersky (very few times). [Experienced this one time in my life] The positive: __________________________________ Avast normaly updates itself silently. It doesn't take long to update the virus database, so online gaming is'nt interrupted. (You are asked beforce big program updates) The anti-virus system of avast is fast and efficient. I never had a better software than this one. Expecially the live shield of Avast is perfect (does alarm sound when you enter a site with a attacking virus). When you do a deeper search for viruses you can also use Avast for this. The software updater usualy works perfect, when you want to use it. Sometimes it causes problems, but resolves it by restoring to pro-install status (if setup fails). (Notifications should be disabled). Avast doesn't use a lot of resources. Nearly none ot the CPU and about 5.000k of RAM (that's nearly nothing). __________________________________ Maybe it doesn't sound like it, but i love Avast for many reasons! It's a wonderfull piece of code to protect your computer from viruses and other bad things. I personally put a link of Avast on my personal homepage, so you can see my support. Greetings from Germany!
Really nice vacation, London is a great town! Very nice and polite people. You can see a lot and you can save a lot of money with The London Pass. Many attractions are represented! But you need at least three days or more, otherwise the pass would not pay off. Great choice and i would do it again and again! Kind regards MS
Clear recommendation ! It surely wasn't my last order at golfstoreeurope.com ...
All worked very smooth. I received a text message from the driver 30min before the pick-up, with his contact details, car, number plate, exact pick-up location; the driver was very friendly and compenet; reach the destination in very short time
Good price, great service and very helpfull. One of the items I wanted was out of stock (I was aware of it while ordering) and I had to wait for it. Meanwhile I placed a second order and asked for it to be "merged" with the first one. This was not a problem and,because no aditional packaging was requiered, I even the second order's transport fee back. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is: international transport. Altough the site says DHL it is in fact Deutsche Post (DP), apparenty DHL and DP are the same company in germany. Due to this fact, delivery took a long time to Portugal (almost 7 weekdays) and was totaly untraceable between Germany and Portugal. If the change to full DHL service or use another company for international delivery (GLS works great). If I could, I would rate them 4.75
- I made my order on 22nd of May and the card was charged immediatly - in the 23rd of May, I receive an e-mail stating that the card (my mother's) was not acceptable and that I had to pay by wire transfer. - I could not pay by wire transfer and on the 24th of May I was told that the order was canceled and that I the card was to be refunded. - this is 29th of May and, in spite of several requests, my order was still not canceled and, most importantly, still no refund. - as of this moment, I'm considering this was in fact,a theft.
I've ordered from Germany. The delivery came after only 4 days after my order. This is the only shop, where i can get the tablets that helps me. The German pharmacy is not capable to produce drugs without adverse effects for me. It's sure that i will order again in this shop.
Gk4 is for me the site if i wanna get some cheap games .The sending of the key is very fast and effectiv
Me and a friend of mine bought 100 referrals each. It said that the order will be finsihed on the 1st of june. The 100 Referrals were added to my Account on the 28th of may and they started to lvl on the 29th. Then on the 30th all hit lvl 10 and i got the RP and the left IP plus the skins! Awesome site! 4/5 Stars because the waitung queue is a bit high. I can highly recommend the site and its much cheaper then buying RP from Riot! Dont worry u wont get banned!
their partner "halo" insurances (Crawford) responses very fast to claims - however I can't help they try to delay the process by asking several questions during the process which are obviously for no other reason (driver's license, twice bank account) I hope that my money will appear on my bank account still within 4 weeks after my claim was opened. Generally I think it's worth to pay the small money for the insurance - compared to the car rental company own ones (which might be in backround same incurances) it's 50% off
I used Otle.com very often - not the cheapest rates but many times free of charge cancelations up to 4 days before your arrival. Refund takes only 2-3 days compared to some competitors (where i takes 30 days!!) this is very fair! Recommend!!
I used a voucher link and continued my booking till "confirm payment" where the voucher was shown as accepted. with pressing "confirm payment" I made a legal contract with hotwire to purchase my hotel room and charge as mentioned below "confirm payment" (screenshot available) - nevertheless they charged me $20 more and refuse to refund the difference. I called 3 times from Germany (free due to free calls to U.S. by my provider), they first told me on the phone to refund $20 but didn't - I called again  they told me they need to review my screenshot. They try to tell me that I wasn't allowed to use the $20 coupon - this doesn't matter: I have confirmed payment of the amount by clicking the button "confirm payment" - they can cancel the booking if they want but they can't charge me $20 more than accpeted - just simple as it is. BTW: they also refuse to cancel the booking as the HW-bookings arenot cancelable... OMG what a criminal and fraud site!!
I'm a long time loyal customer to Hertz and President Circle member in their frequent customers program. For our holidays we usually book car rentals via brokers who offer much better and cheaper insurances if you book in advance. So we did 2012 and 2013 - in 2012 we got a car with tires were totally worn (dangerous in higher speeds on highway), after exchange in Portimao our 2nd car had raggling breaks.... 2013 happend the following scam: I booked via Holidayautos knowing very well that no addional insurances have to be taken at rental desk. The agent tried to sell anyway but I told her after 1min of her "speech" that "no, no, no need - I want to have the rental as it's booked and no extras at all" - she looked a bit confuse about my direct addressing but said "ok" - then she gave me the papers to sign what I did. 1 Week after return I notice that Hertz PT charged my creditcard 85€ - they clarified by email that I have undersigned the rental contract accepting the "CDW without excess" and they send a copy of that signature as a proof. Seems that I signed and didn't read - I trust that a Hertz employee whom I clearly said "no extra" wouldn't fool me - how stupid I was - yes!! Or the other way around: I trusted a company I trust for years that they don't fool me puting someting else to the contract than I have just seconds before trying to address. Hertz Portugal is a licensee, who seems not to work acc. to Hertz international standards where customers are treated with respect and not cheated. Of course you can blame me myself  but I'm just so disappointed as a loyal customer I have been all the years... let's see if Hertz Europe or my broker can correct this - my confidence is gone with Hertz Portugal!!
I used priceline's name-your-own-price ("NYOP") fortune hotel also called Opaque hotel booking for years and got usally some good deals (30-60% lower than official rates). However I have the feeling that somehow this Opaque Hotel business has seen its Zenit? I feel that savings for customer shrink, their "express deals" are sometimes just that they skip their 18-20% provision and offer it as "express deal" - remember non-cancelable!! Good deals: 3.5-5* hotels but remember they charge many things extra (Wifi, parking etc.) in the USA to be careful: 1-3* hotels in USA - sometimes these wins end up beeing more expensive than the official AAA-rates as priceline add their profit in the "taxes and fees" to be very caerful: outside USA, in some European cities offers are limited and the wins can be far outside of city or very old worn properties Also please let me say that to use NYOP requires a huge effort ot learn and understand the system and much time to make sure you won't get wrong hotel when booking. Always remember: if you pay 10% less official rate it isn't worth to book non-cancelable opaque hotels - 10-20% is offered nowadays on many websites which show hotel name before booking and you can cancel for free up to 24hs (or 48hs) before arrival
I used the website several times due to their low rates esp. for the "all-inclusive" excess refund. They don't refund any "admin-fee" in case of damages on return but most partners they work with (cheap local low cost providers) don't even have this fee. I never had an accident and can't say how good the refund process works however I'm a bit disappointed when I checked recently their website and tried to book rental cars for 2014: before year change they offered a complete package "zero excess", now they have an option to choose 5€/calendar day (=+1 rental days): e.g. 12 days in June 2014, I made a booking 2013 and paid for "zero excess" and their profit a total of €52,14 to economycarrentals.com on day of booking (creditcard), at the local partner I need to pay-at-arrival 180€ (local partner Auto Jardim). for identical booking the website shows now €86,42 to be paid at day of booking to Economycarrentlas and 180€ to local partner desk. So they increased their own rates (or proft) 67%!!! The option "zero excess" is selected by default and the price changes automatically: this is against German law, first price must be the endprice, options need to be disabled by default!! some other things which makes it difficult to take this broker serious: - prices care changeing from POS e.g. if you pretend to live in the UK you get offers with 100km free per day and higher price.. - never ever they can tell you who is the local dealer (even they show a evaluation of the local partner) - name of the partner is only disclosed after booking - free cancelation differs from offer to offer but it's bothering to always book and cancel... - no answers to emails (email bounced back) As a summary: too many tricks to cheat - I'd most likely not book anymore....
I made a booking for a very competative price for Singapore, confirmation incl. a voucher were sent within 2 minutes after I gave them my payment details. For 2 weeks booking was confirmed on my olotels.com account, the hotel got my name and confirmed that the booking is guaranteed by Transhotel. Only thing missing: my creditcard wasn't charged yet.... No answers to my emails! Suddenly I received one email saying that the booking had "problems" and they offered my alternative hotel which 850m away, also 5* - nothing else confirmed in that email. They told that the booking will be canceled automatically if I won't confirm the alternative hotel within 48 hours.... One day later they charged 250 EUR to my creditcard Today is 48hrs later, I have sent them 5 emails that I can accept the alternative but I want to know if same conditions apply: deluxe room, breakfast and Wifi included, cancelation terms 4 days before arrival - no answer - but today my online booking account shows: no booking anymore??? Absolutely inaccpetable service, unreliable and canceled the booking without telling me any reason? Edit 28.2.2012: they called me and described how this could happen, seems that the providers do all these cancelation w/o Olotels.com interferance - anyway it took 4 days to clarify... Now they offered me a alternative for same price - I accepted this as the location and star level seems to be equivalent - just got a call from olotels confirming that they will refund me the Wifi I need to pay at the new hotel (as it was free in the booked one): 26 EUR - Bravo - seems that you have understood what is customer service! Thanks to Trustpilot!! I changed my evaluation here because of that improved service attitude - late but better than never.... So be careful here esp. if you get Vouchers by Transhotel - this seems to be the worst provider of all - there are also reports about wrong adresses in voucher (Moevenpick Stuttgart)
Order was delivered online in a matter of minutes, would buy from again.
I like the layout which is used here. Everything seems to be good connected and I never had any problems by ordering something.
Even if I'm using gmx as my email provider I can't recommend it! I'm just using it because I'm bound to pay a charge for it. There is no guarantee that spams will be filtert and I've never seen that much commercial before promoted by an email provider.
What a great website I found while I was looking for some translations for my study. Actually I'm quite new into the german language but with the help of this powerful website I handle my study quite easier than I thought before. Dankeschön! Evelin
I always liked to use this platform to buy second hand articles in the internet and I'm doing this till this day, because it is really safe and easy to use. So there is nothing bad to say about paying via paypall BUT! If you want to sell items you won't be happy with paypal. Read yourself into there terms and conditions and you will be shocked that they are able to take more of your money than you actually want to pay them. Take care Cheers! Evelin
Well said, Enrico! These are exactly the same words I wanted to write down here. I love this platform and I'm using it day in day out. Actually it has been quite a long time I didn't used it and that for some reason. Get in and you know what we are talking about! ;-) Cheers Evelin
I don't know how many people I know who are addicted into this network and I swear you that I won't count them and that just for one reason. They are way too much! For me it looks like people don't now anymore about other activities they can spend there day with than using this website. Just like Gary Jules said: We are living in a mad world! Cheers! Evelin
What a great idea has has been realised by creating this platform. I personally was always looking for such a website which allows me to criticize other's websites. So from now on it's quite easy for me to share my opinions with the www. Cheers! Evelin

We ordered two bags and everything just worked out fine!
I am first time purchaser at this store and my whole expirience has been nothing but good. Status and delivery information are top notch. Lambda is shipping via FedEx so there is absolutely excellent tracking possible on the minute exactly. However one small drawbackk has been in my initial order as I somehow forgot to put in my contact number which is absolutely required for the courier. My order status did not change initially and I did not know if stock was a problem. After my email contact I was informed about the missing number which was corrected so that afterwards the processing started really quick. I wish I would have gotten a note about it so there wouldnt have been an inactive timeframe for my order.
if you need a cdkey for a game or want the digital version of it, go toooooo OnlineKeyStore
Mcdonalds makes the best food in the world it makes me happy. it taste better than homemade and burger King. I was in the UK last year and try Mcdonalds there it was awesome.
Had a great experience buying there, had a little problem with a cd-key but the support solved it for me quickly. Would return!
I am very happy with everything: the selection of brands, the superfast service as well as the very friendly and helpful contact with the staff. Could not be any better!
Flights are ok but the extras are a ripp off! 1 Case 79 Euros theire and back???The mails beforeyou fly claim that it is not too late to book in a case for 10 pounds, when you try to add a case it costs a fortune, it ischeaper to send a case per Yodel. Car hire is even worse, you pay extra for fully comp insurance all in! Ont the phone! But the cover when you read the small print ist worthless and you are looking for trouble! It is all done through a broker who keeps a third of the cost for himself and makes false clames on the phone! I read the small print and canceled my car and got charged 50 Euros for the experience! Book Easy Jet!!!!What you see is what you get.Jet2 hat got a lot to learn
The flowers were delivered one day to late... When I asked customer service why there had not been a delivery on the requested date I didn't get any reply.
I downloaded the free software "trustpilot guard" yesterday. From now on, an icon in either red, orange or green pops up according to the service performance of online companies. I feel much better informed about online shops. Thanks!
Ordered HugoBoss prescription glasses on 4th Jan 2013. Delivery was 8-15 days on their website, which passed by already. I received a mail roughly a week after ordering, saying that the product is available with the supplier and was reserved, and will reach their office at the latest by 19th Jan. I received another mail on 17th Jan saying there is a delay and such delays happen time to time (huh!) and it may take a delay of 5-11 more days for them to receive the frames from the supplier. Then I wrote 2 mails stating to either arrange to deliver on time as promised by your website or cancel the order. for which I have no response from their irresponsible customer service. Then called to their HongKong office and they coolly said "We don't take care of orders and their service, so please write an email to our customerservice". I dont know when I will receive my glasses, and if not when I would receive the refund (read so many reviews about people waiting for more than 3 weeks to receive the refund). In spite of paying the money, am suffering with headaches for weeks and they are least bothered to serve their customer. CONCLUSION: If you are ordering sunglasses for which you are willing to wait for even couple of months, do so; it is cheap and worth. Definitely not worth for the prescription glasses. This website may work for China or HongKong, but definitely not for German population. AVOID LIKE PLAGUE...!!!
my favourite seller, great and fast service, good range of different clothing style
Sent flowers for the fourth time to Brazil - always on time !!!
Sent a partially completed but dated looking CV and they completely transformed it into something modern looking and saying all the right things that I am very pleased with but I do have only one minor criticism, they are terrible at pretending to offer a personal service. It is very obvious that you are only a number (and wallet!) to them. I also purchased the LinkedIn re-write, which was also decent, but they spammed me afterwards trying to up-sell this to me as well sending other emails detailing their other up-sell opportunities which I have also partaken of in my original order. Altogether they produced decent results and I do recommend using them, but do not for one moment think that the service is personal, quite possibly it is a robot producing all of this as they certainly don't read your emails sent to them.
Hi, for several years I know Paddock Spares as a reliabel and experienced supplier for Landrover parts. I allways got what I wasin need for to repair my Defender and the cars of my friends. Best regards and carry on!
My two packs of nanogrip just arrived three days after purchasing. I instantly tested it, not expecting that effect. My mobile phone just sticked to the pad like the belong together. Twisting it will release it. 5/5 - total musthave
Very rapid delivery in a sturdy package and an excellent price. The quality of my 5.11 order is as usual very good. I´ll order again soon at nightgear !!! Oliver
I love using this dictionary to improve my german skills and I'm pretty sure that it helps me a lot. It's absolutely recommendable! Dankeschön!
Our outbound journey was from Dover to Calais. We used an evening ferry crossing after 1/2 a day at work and school. We really would have liked a better quality (food) restaurant with table service. There was nothing to do for the kids. The kids area was bare apart from one gym mat. One staff put a kids film on, but that didn't really help the kids releasing excess energy from a day spend at school and travelling. Our return journey from Dunkirk to Dover was in the morning after spending a night in the early arrivals Motorhome car park at the Ferry terminal. Apart from toilets and showers in the men's toilets only there was absolutely nothing to do. It would have been nice to be able to get some food and drink and a shower in the lady's and perhaps a little playground for the kids as most people using this facility have travelled a long way. I'm also not sure if there is any security at the early arrivals car park but I felt a bit exposed and vulnerable. However, having an early arrivals car park is very handy. The ferrys on this route are a lot better then on the Calais route. However, the quality of the cooked breakfast was poor and tasteless. The food was cold and the kids refused to eat it after tasting it. There was plenty to do on the ferry to keep us all entertained, but the ferry was delayed (no explanation or apology offered) and we had to walk through the smoking area every time we wanted to move from inside the ferry to the outside and vice versa, which is not ideal for non smokers or children. Altogether the crossing offered good value for money and is short enough to put up with a few inconveniences, however, the quality of the food should be improved especially since it isn't cheap.
I booked a Hotel in Buenos Aires via Prestigia. The price appeared to be attractive compared to booking.com which I frequently use.  In the end the Hotel charged a 25% higher price than stated in the prestigia portal. After signaling this issue to prestigia they told me that I am charged with the VAT of 21% and that the rest would be credited by the hotel.  Sorry that I have to share this experience.
My latest order at Alwaysriding.co.uk wasn't my Last! Good information! I always knew the status of my order. Although one product wasn't in stock and sent a little later, everything went well.
Considering the postage cost as much as the costume, and the costume really wasn't anything special (certainly didn't look as expensive as it ended up being), I would not buy anything here again. We paid about €50 and ended up with a costume that looks like it came from the pound shop. Good points: my son was happy enough with it, it fitted ok, and it came on time. Just way too expensive.
I recommend highly, Super Service and reliable fast Shipping (2 days to Germany). I have trust and a good feeling when buying with you guys!
It was rainy and cold and the bus totally packed, not well heated and the visibility out of the windows was little. As the top of the bus is half open, this is no real option on cold and wet conditions.
I order Products by Towerhobbies since 1992 and I like this Company
easy order with a lot of choice in all glasses- we had a quick delivery although i had a mistake in my order (my fault) - select specs: a good choice!
A while ago a I ordered an iNew V3 through Howsea. I ordered it with delivery by DHL, but it lasted very long. Howsea investigated the issue and found out that DHL had problems sending packages with 2 batteries. So mine was refused. To prevent further delay Howsea immediately sent me at their expense an iNew from ther European warehouse. After a few days I received my fine iNew V3. But after 2 months the V3 was broken. Howsea checked and sent me a new (other) phone just within a few days. Well, that is what I call service. No nonsense guarantee, fast clear communication in Dutch and excellent service. I know where I will buy my next phone. Superb value for money.
Really impressed with the value for money on your high quality products and the short delivery times (as well as free delivery) to Germany.
My wife and I searched for a comfortable hotel in Rom. Then she found "easytobook". It was one of the cheapest site for the hotel we want to stay in. So I booked there. One Thing is not so good; I don´t know if the creditcard will be debt the day I booked or two weeks before we´ll go to Rom.
Everything went fine and the price seemed ok as it included the insurance, but Hertz charged me 20 EUR "Einweggebühr", which is when you don't give your vehicle back at the same location where you received it. I rented the vehicle from Frankfurt to Bielefeld and gave it back at Hertz Bielefeld, so I was quite surprised: I really thought this was already included. In English they call what they charge you a "Pick-up service", but it is misleading called: they charge you for a “one way fare”.
The delivery to Germany took 10 working days, which is very fast. The polishes arrived intact but the packing was not very secure. The polishes could have been broken on the way. The prices are unbeatable and the products are top quality :) Very nice. Would buy there anytime again
The page is easy to use for everyone between 14-99 years. There are so many reviews and always also recent ones. Prices and locations were everytime correct and easy to find with the help of the map.
I made some very good experiences to trust the customer reviews on TripAdvisor or the TripAdvisor Certificates often presented in stores or hotels. Kerp up the great work you are doing!
In my opinion the best and cheapest Key Store :) You can earn money if you advice this site with an secial personal link. I boght 2 Games, both purchases were perfect. I never tried or i never should tried the Support, but i think this would be also be so perfect like the other services.
I appreciate the easyness to just add trustpilot insurance to my deal
Payed lowprice for a good game and got the key fast and it worked. All u need ^^
Bought a couple of games at OKS and all of them delivered instantly. Just a perfect service!
Performance of the site : good Offer : good Tendancy to increase the price depending on search activity : inacceptable
I ordered in September some things at intimates21. They delivered only have of the things without any notice that the other things are not availible. In an email I asked why they didn't deliver and after that I got the answer: Thinks are not in stock and I have to wait...ok...I wait...for 6 month now!!!!!!!!!! I wrote 2 times after that but never heard anything from the company...and I paid with paypal by ordering... First the get your money and you don't get anything of your order...that's fraud!!!!!
The code was delivered not even a minute after I ordered it! Very satisfied!!
if u register with the referrer code MP757518 u can get 5% discount for everything :) and for sure u can use more discount codes in basket. i paid for 5kg impact whey 52 Euro. Very good deal :) Now to the products : I've been trying lots of different protein shakes over the years and some are better than others. I'm not one to heap praise for the sake of, but I have to say the My Protein Impact Whey Protein is the BEST I've tried. Flavours are typically awful to ok with other brands but I tried the chocolate and coconut and I absolutely love it, I could drink it all day! So all in all great product and will buy again
I used the Code de parrainage MP757518 a Enregistrer  to save 5% discount on my order and that makes the prices even more cheaper :) ... The quality is very good and i like the taste.
BE AWARE, don't book with them. fluege.de charged my credit card 3 time for the same ticket, and then send me an email saying that my credit card wouldn't accept the payment, however my bank insist that the money has been charge and is waiting for approval. After trying to cancel everything they charged me with a fine of 100€!
I placed orders 3 times, but the delivery just nerver arrives. I can't tell you just how frustrating it is, when you'r just so exciting for your order to arrive and after 4 week - nothing. The costumer service isn't informed at all and don't you expect them to have any empathy what so ever... Of course I got my money refunded, but everytime I place an international order (since I live in Germany) I have to pay a fee wich I'm not getting back!! I'm ordering online on many different sites and it has never been a problem....only Topshop.com just doesn't seem to get it right
I like hostel world and when I'm searching for a hostel, it's always the first site I visit. But comparing the prices to other sites I'm sometimes forced to book elsewhere. I also think there should be more options when searching for the perfect hostel. I'd like to sort hostels by different criteria not only average rating, but e.g average rating on location or fun.
I will start saying that I have been a loyal and satisfied customer of Sixt. I live in Munich, but work different places and have always used Sixt, as they had an agreement with the company, and with no problems for 2,5 years. last weekend, I had a short personal trip to Denmark, where I rented a car for 2 days. I returned the car as usual, didn't need to check the car with the employee, as there have never been a problem. That was a big mistake! 20 minutes later I get a protocol clarifying that SIXT had found a 5-10 cm deep scratch on the right rear side of the car, which will cost me 8.120 DKK, as I didn't have full insurance. I call SIXT emidiately telling them they have made a mistake, which they actually confirms. So here I think this is now settled, but NO. very late the same day the reclaim the damage on the car and informs me they have pictures of the damage, without sending the pictures to me. I of cause ask them to forward me the pictures, which they still haven't done. And only because I had to go to a place rather near the SIXT office I go there to clarify the subject with them. I even get to go see the car and I take a dosens pictures of the car, and none of them with any damage on the car. I inform the SIXT employee about this, but she was suddenly unable to do anything, not even showing me the pictures they apparently had of the damage. So I was to send my pictures to SIXT on a mail, and then she would inform her superior, whom would contact me the next day. I send the pictures on mail and make it clear that I expect an apology. But here 4 days after, they still haven't contacted me. They have though sent me an invoice without the charge of the damage. This is for a classic example of a rental company trying to cheat a foreign customer, as they properly expected I was long gone. I would say if SIXT have given me an apology of their behavior I would might have considered to use them again in the future, but now all confidence in their capabilites and trust is completely gone.
Over all a professional supplier of the Prince2 seminar, with a competent and friendly trainer, who explains and shows the different theories in a manner where it is understandable for all people. The trainer also took the necessary time to answer the questions from the participants properly and if needed he used some of the times in the pauses to explain these issues.
Initially, I was a bit sceptic about ordering sunglasses online, yet everything was just fine. Committed company, reliable and product delivered on time and in one piece. One slight note, price paid for delivery was higher than initially committed/paid (10€ more), but still making the offer affordable!
The website would be better if you could improve the load speed.
Good prices in relation to other shops and very good payment methods, what's good too is that OKS saves your keys in your account you cannot lose 'em!
I paid immediately per Paypal and payment was confirmed on site. After two days I contacted the support - No reply apart from a message that the support is busy. I was just filling out the PayPal-Buyerprotection as the Email arrived. First buy and ultimately the last one.
I live in Germany and we have problems to buy games in uncut here :(. I bought often games in the Shop of online key Store and i dont have Problems to activate keys. Another cause why i Buying Keys here is they are Cheap :)
Your web site is the best on the market. Products are easy to find and pricing is easyly changed to foreign currencies. A pleasure to choose the parts looking fore and checking the pric info. Some pricing is well based others are too high. A quick check is possible today by the internet. It is up to the customer then to decide what priority he has. Delivery is fast to fix the car as soon as possible. Thank you for your service and best regards from Germany - Roland Mann
If you are looking to buying household equipment at a reasonable price, then you won't go far wrong here. They sell display items in excellent condition. Although I had ordered and purchased a two man delivery only one turned up. In fairness, The Gassuperstore refunded this extra charge without a quibble. Consequently, I have had good purchase experience and will be using them again.
I'm so in love with my new Onesie and my new shoes. I got them today and I'm wearing them the whole time. Can't wait for my christmas vacation where I will stay in bed for a few days with my cuddly Onesie!
Ordered two Chairs, November 26, 2011. Having read the terribly poor ratings this company has, I canceled my order via e-mail by November 27, 2011, being afraid If I would ever see any chairs. Still, on November 28, 2011 Infurn booked the full price off my credit card! Just to be sure sent a cancellation letter, certified mail with return receipt, on December 2, 2011, setting a 2 weeks deadline for refund, another one Dec. 16. 2011, again two weeks deadline for refund. There has been no reaction by INFURN up to now what so ever, let alone that I would have got my mony back! I shall be happy to make up my mind in case this company starts to show some basic degree of trustworthy, credible and professional internet busines towards me, and correspondingly update my review, but up to now I can only WARN doing ANY BUSINESS with INFURN !!! STATUS UPDATE 27.01.01 Finally got my money back; but only after handing the case over to my credit card company. They made a recall on my money. Never heard anything from infurn, ever! STAY AWAY!!!!! PS: if you are looking for design replica, look for "blue sun tree" or "home concept" both do not have such terribly poor ratings as infurn, and are often even cheaper
I bought an evening tail coat (Frack) . the first one die not suit well, so I have to send it back and order a different size. This fits very well. What I didn't like was that I have to pay three times for freight (orgnal, sending back and the new one. Than I order a vest a bow tie and a shirt. The vest is a one size fits all, however it does not fit, so I would not recommend others to buy it. The shirts fits well. The bow tie is from cheap production. the elastic band of bith vest and bow tie get chapped after 5 times wearing
few minutes after email enquiry got all answers. best price best terms of warranty shipment to germany in warp speed looking out for competitive dealer here in germany..... negative... will buy again
How did they look? You ask for my opinion but I don't know if they were delivered and I don't know if they were delivered on time. You could improve your service by sending me an email with a photo of the flowers attached stating when (date and time) they were delivered. The flowers were for a funeral so I don't expect to hear from the recipient That would be customer service above expectations...............
I bought one shirt and created one by myself - it was really easy to do and now after 2 weeks the shirts arrived. Good quality and they really look very good. I think I will order some more shirts in the next time.
I would always order again. I can only recommend it to you.
... but had no problems with the activation of the key.
The Nisnas fender for Brompton arrived here in Germany in the afternoon the 24th after ordering them on Sunday the 22nd - thats hard to beat. Beautiful fenders for my black Brompton by the way and a nice Chrismas present. Thanks!
beautiful poster print...great design, very fast delivery. I would use photo world always again :)
I have purchased 2 rugs, the shipping was very fast and the rugs are really nice, very pleased!
I made an order with delivery in denmark and after 4 days i had my new coolbox. Product and speed of delivery was perfect. Søren, Randers, Denmark.
I have rented cars with EconomyCarRentals many times, in many countries as: Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Morocco etc. I always experienced very good service for good value.
Overall I am very satisfied and relieved to have gotten my back tax forms filed and sent off. I think the Price was fair and since I was filing several years at once, I got a substantial Discount. I had some Problems with the Software. It wasn't always clear to me where some of the files had been put for me to Review. However, all my questions and Feedback were dealt with immediately via email and I felt supported and in good Hands. IMHO the tax preparer's really know the ins and Outs of all the new rules and regulations that the IRS have imposed on Ex Pats... I have not heard anything back from the IRS regarding my Returns, so I'm hoping no News is good News!!
The games are totally cheap and it´s good for buying new games.
I love the shop in London and adore the shop and all those creative people there. I had some contact regarding an order and shipping it abroad. That was outstanding and I can highly recommend the shop. I wish they would put more and more stuff into the onlineshop, because I'm not as often in London as I want to be.
I could be called as an daily visitor of this homepage, because that's what I'm doing day in day out: Learn new vocabularies at leo.org. And yes! It helps me a lot so that I can just recommended this homepage.
I really like this homepage and what it is used to. But in my opinion there a not that much people who are using it the way is should be used.
This review is rather a warning than a review: Please do not book with Elumbus. I made the mistake twice in my life. In one case, I was unhappy with how a case was handled, but let me not get into this. Yesterday, by accident I booked again with Elumbus for a flight today. Obviously time matters in such cases. What I received was an on-screen message giving a "time out error": An email will provide further information and will clarify whether the booking has been made or not. This email never arrived. The company was unreachable and refused to give any information. Since the flight was very expensive, for obvious reasons, this is a catastrophe: I did not know whether I had a flight, whether I spent a lot of money, and most importantly, whether I would have to rebook. And all because Elumbus cannot use functioning booking software and apparently does not care. Given the repeated appalling experiences in the past, I can only warn you not to come close to this company.
I had a really convenient experience with this website, I ordered a Dark Souls 2 EU key but they told me it was undeliverable due to restrictions, so they gave me a RUS key with a 12 € voucher! I am really happy with my purchase, the activation process with the manual was really easy and everything works well, thanks a lot!
Travel Nation is easy to contact and the consultants are very quick with replying to requests. Everyone we were in contact with (Cali and Jackie) was very friendly and supportive and the air fare offered was great. We definitely can recommend Travel Nation.
I enjoyed the tours I booked with NY Pass but I couldn't use offers as many as I wished to do. So for me it was not a good deal because I did only three tours...but would still recommend it!
I bought a pair of Clarks sandal last week. It has been delivered within two days without extra price! Surprisingly quick! Rubbersole sent also the progress of delivery via e-mail so that you could track your order. A really nice service. Highly recommended!
I just bough 'Clarins Eye make-up remover gentle 125ml' for £14 which is nomally £18 on Clarins' official website. I have meanwhile a Loyalty Plus member status so I do not the delivery so I shop regularily with Secretsales. It is a very easy and convenience way to shop. The website is very well structured and the payment is also very safe.
thanks because of the fast delivery.the ordered objects are perfect
We ordered a hockey stick for my son and got great advice from the site's info page about different features of different sticks, better than i had from live shop assistants here in Dublin. One stop shop and really fast delivery!!
This is exactly what I needed! Instead of going to many different job boards and repeating my search over and over, now I can do everything without leaving Adzuna. As it gathers all of the job ads from around the Internet, I could easily find my future job through its comprehensive and clean website. The provided tools, as the salary statistics, are a great extra, which helped me better understand the current job market.
I am a regular customer of GamerKeys.net and i am really happy, that i found this Keystore. Prices are very cheap, the Keys did ALWAYS work, and even if they are RU only, it is well guided how to get it working. The given VPN is the best of all which makes this Keystore the best of all i have found yet. Hope they will keep that top service :)
Ordered some DPF cleaner and the website asked for my car registration to make sure the item was suitable - very reassuring. Item was well packaged and delivered promptly, what more can you ask? Oh, and it was cheaper than buying from ebay.  Result!
I just love Vistaprint! They have so many special offers and a very good quality. Recomend them whenever I´m asked by friends...
Bought from these twice now through ebay. Good company with good prices, fast postage and good customer service. An enjoyable experience from start to finish :)
Ordered a pair of le chameau vierzonord on 25/11/12 still no arrival 19/12/12, nearly 1 month later! Every time I called or emailed I was told "They should be with you in 2-3 days" Liars! Claimed money back through pay pal, which admittedly they did quickly, the only thing they actually did do satisfactorily.
I have never had problems with HRS. Booking is really easy and sure. I have never had problems with any hotel, HRS is like an insurance police.
I ordered memory for my mac mini. This site offered the best price and promised fast delivery. The memory arrived first class next day. No problems, this is the way it should always be.
warning this company doesn't send the payed goodswaited mor then 6 weeks and my paid goods never arrived. serveral mails to tmart.com customer service were only standard answers. booked my money with a claim via paypal back.
I ordered Beta-Alanine and L-Tyrosin with the best value for money I know so far, good quality and cheap, received in short time without any problems. Recommend it to anyone who is thinking to buy it there.
Yes, the price was the best there is. But... * Article arrived later then promised in their warehouse without any additional letter or message to let us know * Liefferzeit should be 3 to 7 days and will now be 16 days But the worst: Delivery can take place between 7 and 18 and if I want to have a more fixed time I need to pay additional cost (at least afternoon or morning would be reasonable)
I already ordered some keys from SimplyCDKeys and I am more than pleased. They deliver fast and offer a variety of payment options. I am pretty satisfied with the reliability of this page and classify them as trustworthy.
Ordering with Awesomebooks is great. It takes a couple of days until the books arrive here in Germany but every Penny spent ist werth doing so.
Always a great way to see the main sights in a new city!!!
otel has often very nice hotels with good prices. but is not clear for me if i could cancel or change a reservation if my travel schedule has to be changed. as i understand, the price paid is lost.
We always order the yummy italian - so very delicious stuff from them. They are fast in delivery, reliable in quality (!!!) and have a nice, personal service if you have questions!
flowers were delivered on time pretty, fresh, colorful flowers with awesome scent will definitly order my flowers here the next time too
I order my sunglasses there for years and the service is excellent as well as the prices. I returned my OP shades and got immediate delivery of a different version of the glasses. Very good overall performance!
Olotels has often the best price, however the navigation and use of the website can be confusing.
Booked a car for 3 days at Atlanta Airport through hotwire. Got charged $ 155 total for a midsized USV. Upon arrival at Hertz they were flabbergasted about the category as they had an economy booked for me as per instructions from Hotwire, no midsize SUV available !! Only choice was a category in between. So I already was overcharged there. Btw, I had the same issue 9 months earlier when booking a car for Johannesburg, South-Africa, where they didn't even have that type of car - an Audi A3 on picture at hotwire - in their fleet !!. Back home from Atlanta I now get an additional invoice from Hertz for $ 216.26 (so 139% ON TOP OF hotwire rate !!) for additional charges (of which the GPS was only $ 36, the rest (mandatory) insurance fees) ! This has definitely been the last time I booked via hotwire.... They were good a few years back, but based on the above 2 examples, they are now engaging in fraudulous activities ! If I would get the option of no stars, I would have as even 1 star is one too many !
I wanted to contact them in chat what they do offer. During the chat the service assistant stopped, without answering any questions, not saying he would have to leave, simply nothing and I was waiting half an hour. If any employee would act like this in my company I´d call him to wether change or leave.
Wide range of good products, very good background information about products, not only  supposed to boost their products, but remindig the customers of their own responsibility.
Well, it's not the fastes Key site but it worked. I ordered MW3 and after 10 minutes I got the working Key.
I Found it Very easy to find information and book the hotel
I never believed how Wikipedia could help me on almost daily matters. I hope German edition will also increase its size and # of pages (but after all, it's all abt us...)
I am glad having found trustworthy remailer from the UK. I reside in Germany and many UK sellers unfortunately and for reasons beyond my comprehension, don't ship to Germany. Therefore, even though coastwise on the heavier side, an quick, easy to use and reliable remailer is needed. Skypax is a winner.
Nothing special. Service of Car del Mar was alright, support from the local car provider was good at the counter but no hotline was available in an appropriate waiting time for further questions. Take back procedure was easy, too easy, no check or protocol.
If you don't know about something Google is the tool to use! Actually you can explore about all and everything you're looking for, because Google knows everyhting. It just depends on the way of usage.
I made my first online purchase on this site and everything went smoothly. The process was intuitive and easy to follow. It took some time until my keys were shipped, but they warned it's like this on the first purchase so I'm fine with that. They contacted me personally after the purchase to make sure everything was alright. I also appreciated their customer support availability. Overall, I would buy from this site again.
It's a great website and I would use it again.
From the inquiry stage right  through to delivery XL Displays have been extremely helpful. They kept in contact and updated me on all the aspects of my order. when I needed some modifications to the graphics this was resolved at short notice and without any drama - and at a realistic cost. I will definitely use XL Display again and would have no hesitation in recommending  them to others. Excellent service, excellent products, and nice people to deal with - what more could you ask for!!
I do have to say that beside the customer service it is a good platform which I used for some bookings and did not have a problem with. But my parents did have a problem and contacted the 9flats phone support. The person on the phone told them that they would help them. After not getting an answer for two days we tried to reach out via email. After another ten days they wrote again and also tried the phone, where no one answered on a normal business day. Still no answer after we wrote on their facebook wall and tweeted to them. After a second tweet which expressed the frustration I got a call from a 9flats representative. He looked into the case and we talked about the details. It was a good talk and he told me they are working on it right now. I could understand his position (they have to discuss the case with the insurance company) but he told me that it was not a really bad performance and that my tweet was exaggerated. I do think that not answering on different channels for 14 days is a bad performance. I hope the case gets solved now and will have to decide later if I use the platform again.
i payed the Domain selling Service with 69$ since then no Feedback on emails any more. did i got cheated? After 8 weeks no feedback, so yes, they are cheating people to pay for an domain name, but this is only an sellerservice where you never will reach your aims.
Hello, can you give me news of my order No. 006089 of 16/04? I notice that I have no response to my comment of 24/04. The need is urgent my order and I hope you can respond quickly to my expectations thank you
I booked via onhotels.com, because the Kayak App shows me the best price for the hotel. I only asked for a invoice including taxes - nothing else. Wrote a few emails now, but I didn't got an answer since one month! Can't believe!
I ordered from Germany and received the goods after only four days in good condition. Definitely will use the services of Vivomed again.
There online shop is just as brilliant as there local shop. I love them both. They are doing this thing for a couple of years now as an world wide known recordstore. Keep up the good work!
Good service and the delivery to my address in Holland was in time.
Ordered first time even from a different country and except long postal delivery everything worked out as expected - Highly recommended!
The Kindness of the arranger at the counter was not the best. I rent the Car at Alicante Airport in Spain.
We would like to order every time our carpets with carpetvista again, because the picture of the carpets in the internet show the patina, the material and the colour like in the reality. The delivery was exactly in time.
This is from the despatch confirmation e-mail I got from zavvi a couple of days after ordering a PS3 game (should be easy to ship this one..) - and I think this already says enough: We ask you to wait 10 working days for UK deliveries and 20 working days for overseas deliveries before you contact us to let us know you have not received your item. This is my worst online shopping experience ever.
I ordered an Zenith watch and had few questions. The company answered me all details around the watch. The delivery was very ultra fast. I ordered, the company received next day the money and on the next day send the watch on the direct way to me. 1 working day and the watch was my hands. The delivery was from UK to Germany. The price of the watch was more than awesome. I saw the watch never for such good price than in other Stores.
I'm a customer from germany and had my third ordering last week and I´m a fan about this site with a easy style for ordering (don't forget the great pictures) very fast delivery and great quality at  the products. I´ll come back :-)
An useful place to find a cheap & comfortable accomodiation, if you are looking for a great adventure. No need to pay too much bucks for a privat room, if there is a chance to meet up with the same globetotters, as you :-)
As mentioned by other reviewers, the ratings aren't accurate enough and I have made suggestions to how this could be improved but unfortunately all I got was "Your ticket 245424 is deemed resolved" and that I should rate Trustpilot so here I am doing so...
While travelling in ASIA recently, I did try to use HMA to access German "Mediathek" - failed to establish myself as being in Germany.
i like your keys (so far they have all worked without a hitch) but your delivery is slower than some other sites..
The variety of sunglasses at 'Giant Vintage' is huge. I ordered three, payed a cheap price for shipping to germany and got my package unbelievably fast.
Great stuff my hollidays started with a brand new golf as a car rental deal instead of a Citroen C3 ! cheers buddy
perfect service, most mentionable is just 1 GBP surcharge on credit cards
small problem with this autokey thing but after a few hours it wokred out fine. thanks alot.
i bought a key there and payed by moneybrookers cause PayPal and all other paymentmethods need to be verified with difficult methods. (but thats ok, everyone does this in other ways) got the key after 24h. (not fast, not slow, its ok too) but now the real annoying thing: i've asked in a ticket if this game what i wanted to buy is region free. After 48h no answer but an Mail that my ticket would be automatic closed if i don't answer so i logged in, looked in the ticket and??? no respons from Support...so on what kind of message should i respond when there is no message? Anyway, i got my answer from an other source so i bought it, cause it sould be region free. . i typed in the key and tried to activate it. the Programm says that this key is invalid so i made an screen to verify what i would write to the support. Made an ticket and waited. The only answer i've got from there was i should contact the publisher support and i was warned to say where i've got the key from. Sorry guys but an invalid key is you're problem not mine. You send me the wrong key, you have to solve my problem. That's no support, thats rip off! Money is gone and all i've got is an invalid key. Thanks for nothing and be sure you never see me buying anything from this store again.
found it cause i was looking for an new keyshop cause i've got problems with my old distributor. And thats what i've got: - fast no.., nearly instant delivery (every bought game in 1h) - competently support (personal, friendly and answering every question) - fast support - easy transactions - functional keys - low prices or in other words: it's now my standard distributor.

We have used FloraQueen for a couple of years now - funerals, birthdays, Christmas and to welcome a relative to a new home. The service has always been outstanding, and everybody was overwhelmed with the flowers/plants. Also with the long time the bouquets kept fresh an nice. We would recommend the firm to anybody without hesitation!
It gathers products from different popular online shops, so you don't have to visit them all! Shoppala.com is operating in Turkey. In other European countries the name "Shopalike" is used.
This purchase started the bad way: order was canceled without a prior notice... I just called them and talked to Jake, very friendly. The colour I wanted was not in stock anymore. He fixed the price issue by sending me a voucher so I could place another order for another colour at the same price. Order placed on monday, delivered on thursday (and I don't live in the UK) so it went fast, vey fast. I will order form them again!
very easy to use. good overview and straight forward website.
It's always worth to check the prices at code4game.com. They have good offers and very fast delivery
fast delivery ! all good ! anytime again ! ;) thumbs up !!
Found through airline-direct a much cheaper flight (with KLM) that any shown on the KLM website itself, or than any shown on any of the other booking portals. I'll come back to airline-direct anytime.
It is pretty easy to find suitable hotels in the requested region. Booking process is smooth and easy to handle.
I always buy US iTunes Gift Cards and they always come in so quick per email .... Thanks PC Game Supply!
Please sell a greater variety of JBS Underwear and socks .... your range is very limited!
I went through a lot of hassle until I received the product I paid for.
I bought a printer with this company and contacted their support for help with incompatibility issues I experienced. I received none.
Very satisfied with what this program does. No need to remember your passwords and other bunch of details – this software will add them for you.
I love my net Macbeth Madrid. I ordered on Monday and the shoes came on Wednesday morning. I'm living in germany
Booking is easy and fast; Side speed could be a little bit faster
ordered from Germany at Internet, 3 days later goods arrived - perfect!
I had to phone the company several times to get my money back.They have very good price but how they work, that´s terrible. Never again!
The service is the only one I found that's really working. It took around 30 minutes to topup the phone of my girlfriend in Zambia from the U.K.. I'm really happy. The whole process needed only 2 minutes of my time, although I had no account before and had to fill everything in. That was for sure not the last time I used it.
Its my second time ordering games at gameholds. The delivery is very fast and the support is awesome as they always respond extremely fast. I got a problem with the last game orderes as there was a typo in the serial. So i wrote to the service and got a response within 5 minutes - nowadays not normal at all. Now everythings perfect - definately recommended!
very uncomplicated booking procedures... prompt and polite response to enquiries...
Detected during a search via GOOGLE, good prices with a large offer of different products. Clear and understandable descriptions, good are the videos to see the handling. Today ordered in UK and three days later delivered in Germany. Pure simplicity to by.
It worked great until a couple of months ago, I tried from a lot of devices with fast internet. Even so it is one othe greatest video colletion of all time.
At the beginning I was enthusiastic about busuu. It is a great idea and learning a languange the busuu way is just a lot of fun and it works! My enthusiasm came to an abrupt end when suddently learning units I had long finished were displayed as uncompleted, and my "berries account" showed a random number, among other things. On top of that, my Android version of busuu stopped working. I assume that the whole problem has something to do with the synchronization between the Android and PC version. Despite numerous emails, the issue was never resolved and busuu were also unable to restore an old status of my account.
It was my first time using Cicar. I really had no idea what I am getting into but I have no complaints. The only thing I wish was to get the car i booked. But that's not always the case. No hidden charges or extras,  all insurances covered and no hassle delivering it back.
Ordered THREE (!) tickets from their website, received a confirmation mail that I bought ONE (!) ticket for the price of 3. Send them two mails on this issue - but never replied or received any information from them. Even the card(s) have not been sent out ! RIPPED !!!
I like the layout and also the little square boy. The website seems to work properly. Well done!
Hostelworld.com is the best side to find the right hostel... They have the biggest amount of hostels listed above all hostel booking websides! Plus you are always provided heaps of good information and really good subjective opinions and complains so that you can be perfectly attuned to what you will be expecting!
I bought Far Cry 3 for a very good price and i got it after 10minutes ! Nice server but it would be nice if the shop add paypal.
I ordered two times and everything was fine ! Autokey system is awesome !
After being in email contact with watchfinder for 2 months I took the chance of a business trip and made an appointment at Maidstone to see "my" IWC Ingenieur which was confirmed to be in new condition. I was surprised that watchfinder is located not in a store but just a normal building hence I had a few difficulties to find them. The salesman was courteous and the watch really looked good. He could competently answer all my questions. The watch was with all papers and original box which is rare for its 21 years of age. Unfortunately being back home I saw a significant dent on the caseback which made me really disappointed. As watchfinder does not offer return for watches that have been purchased from their stores I felt fooled although it is my fault not to have checked thoroughly enough. Nevertheless all other aspects were fine but the dent was really a pity. Watchfinder then was really trying to sort the issue, offered to refurbish but unfortunately I am in the UK very rarely. So I agreed to a complementary membership in their club and the offer to refurbish later. I was now in their shop again, 1 year after the purchase, because I did not have an earlier option, and they confirmed their offer to refurbish. So I left the watch with them and they tried several options and finally they got a goldsmith involved who did a fantastic job. There is still some very little remaining dent but in fact it is almost invisible. So I can clearly confirm that their customer care is outstanding, however my clear advice to all customers is to fully inspect the watch in each and every detail and use a magnifying glass, especially as their room in Maidstone is not well lightened.
We are new customers at lastminute, and I can say we are so happy that we chose your company to travel with. I have panic fear, and yesterday I wrote Alltours about my problem, and already today we got an answer that they have give me and my husbond a seat in front of the plane. We are so happy for the service you have been given us, and if the hotel is good too - I can tell you It wont be the last time we have bought a vacation from you. And STEPHAN - you are the best.... Hugs from both of us for your wonderful service you have provided us with. Thankyou so much in advance
I was delighted to find this online shop. Since a few month our dog has thyroid hypofunction and tablets are really expensive here in Germany (not only Thyforon). VioVet was the only shop that accepted my German prescription and the delivery took only 10 days including 2 weekends. Strange enough even the shops based in Netherland weren't able to process my order.
This is the second time we used rentalcars.com and we will keep on using them.  It is an excellent outfit.
bought F1 2013. it was very cheap and i received it within minutes. nothing bad to say. keep up the great work ! :)
That's awesome again. This was my second order from DigitalRev. Ordered on a Friday evening in Germany the article arrived on Monday from Hongkong. Safe and well packed, the article quality was as expected.
I have bought Splinter Cell Blacklist + DLC Key, which was very cheap, sent fast in friendly written mail. The DLC was sent a half week later via mail from gameholds.com!?! There could be need a pickup!!!
If you want value for your money, I would highly recommend Laila Monroe. 3 months ago I searched high and low for a reliable company, as I was a little bit reluctant to buy online, but my younger daughter couldn’t been happier with her prom dress. It was absolutely gorgeous - great quality, fit well; the length was perfect and came exactly when I was told. Usually I get confused with the sizing but her dress was made to measure, so we didn’t do any additional alterations on it. The staff is attentive, kind and helpful.
Since years I book all of the hostels through Hostelword and never had any Problems. I like that you have a good overview about which backpackers are in town (love that you can choose to see them on a map) and you see very easy which are free, the Price and much more. Always read the recommends before I book the Hostel. This really helps. It's also great that you can compare 5 different ones. Only thing sometimes I would like to search about certain facilities and this doesn't always work I guess it's also because the Backpackers not always provide all the informations. One Thing I really don't like is that you can pay the deposit only in USD, EUR or Pounds and not in the local currency. For Example When I'm in Australia I would like to see de deposit taken in AUD so it would be much easier to controll the creditcard bookings.
I ordered 5 Shirts from this site. After ordering I wasn't able to access my account anymore, I also didn't get a confirmation email. I tried several times to ask them about my payment ect. but I only got copied and pasted answers. :/ I got my order very fast. But that's the only good point about that shop. The shipping costs are worse btw. The quality is terrible. They sent me 2 wrong items and all items had the wrong color. They do not look like they do in the pictures! Be aware and DO NOT order at wholesale-dress.net.
We got everything very quick and every question was answered very quick.
This service is always fast and reliable. We used it to transfer money to Kenya and to Uganda.
I bought now at 50 games at OnlineKeyStore. The last one was Battlefield 4 + premium, the prices are unbeatable. The delivery was quickly. Therefore OnlineKeyStore is my number 1 gameseller. I would be very happy if I win then I would give the win to my best friend because he just deserves :-)
Clear product descriptions, plenty of support, reasonable prices and fast delivery. Haven't got a bad thing to say about this site. Will continue to purchase here in the future.
Bought Octodad which was advertised with instant delivery. Did not receive the key and requested to cancel the order due to this. Did receive the key after 17 hours, but I already bought the game myself through Steam and got an response after that stating the cancellation could not be processed because the key was delivered. --- update: Clearly they don't like negative reviews, because I received an mail from trustpilot saying: The following words/sentences in your review have been detected as coarse language: "". So it seems they just report the negative ones for coarse language and hope the users don't take the time to go to through the process of reinstating their review. Makes me feels the 1 star rating is even too high...
The nice thing about TheHut is here uncensored games can be obtained in the contrast between Germany and at a significantly lower price! The delivery is free shipping even after Germany and my package arrived after just 3 days! Another nice service is a private parcel sent the TheHut for each article and that no bill! If even what should be stuck at customs you can trigger his goods "cheap" with a corresponding invoice. Thank you for the free bottle ice tea in the shoes :) Sorry for the bad english^^
OnlineKeyStore is a great store if you're looking for a store that delivers very fast, has good prices and always all the new games you could possibly want. I'll definitely buy there again and so should anybody else do;). Greetings
I am satisfied client for more than five years now and again the order exceeded all expectations. Delivered simple in letter format to my postbox (no pickup from post office required) and the battery is much more performing than the original one ever has been.
I would highly recommend using Bella Barista ... they were very helpful in our purchase of a Rocket Coffee Machine and Eureka Grinder. Their email contact during the transition was brilliant and we received our order quickly. They also rang us to ensure that we were buying the correct products and showed us where we could make a saving,
I ordered for the first time, everything worked very well. delivery to central europe was very fast indeed and the service personal and very effective. I can fully recommend golfonline.co.uk!
I'm very happy to have found this online shop! They offer a great service and fast delivery, the clothes are beautiful and really great prices. I will remain loyal customer! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!
I ordered some bed linen on Urbanara. The customer service rep was really nice and she helped me decide which product to choose. The delivery took a while but I got a really high quality product which i love :-)
i would be great if more filters would be added. thanks
I would like recommend everybody to use My solution. They have fast order confirmation, fast delivery, good packed and protect goods. Very good company.
Your stuff (clothing and skate things) is really very cool and even with acceptable prices (when you have -%)! This time I had to change an item because it was damaged, nobody told me that that item wasn't at stock any more, so that I get my money back: The communication between seller and customer should be better and tell me there is no more in stock what I wanted to change: in this case I would have like the same jacket but in another color, which was in stock. I wrote to your customer service, but they didn't answer me something usefull. Nevertheless, I will continue visiting your shop and I hope next time you give me a free sticker or so. Thanks.
I have purchased al least 3 times here and you never give me an extra code for -10-15% off. Or how about free stickers? But you are reliable and I like to buy here! You sell things that aren't in Germany and therefore you are some special...
I very often book accomodation through Hostelworld and have never had any issues with them. Search function is easy to use, results are relevant and the booking process is fast and direct. I always recommend the tool!
All in all not the best shopping experience. Shipping time could be faster and the replies from the customer service wasn't the non plus ultra. anyway thanks for the inexpensive deal!
I was just browsing to find my absolutely adorable JC Litas and i finally found it on free people. First, i was afraid because i planed to ship it to Germany, and i didn't do something like this before. But everything went well. I ordered, payed and 2 1/2 weeks later and a long humbling process i finally got my Litas. Beautiful packed in a pink plasic and a free people sticker. It was really girly, really lovely. Everything was great and easy. But one thing i really forgot to think about. When the package arrived you have to pay the tax additionally. So you have to bear in mind that if this should be an international shipping, you have to pay those costs too.. First I thought it was included in the price, but this wasn't so. But anyway, I'm confident and happy. Thanks so much free people!
Asos got many different styles and offers a big rage of great fashion items. The website is clean which i really prefer and really appreciate. Unfortunately asos is only in GB, really hoping they expend to germany as well. i really like to see and try those items first. You should know, I'm a really newbie of online shopping. But ok, i gave them a try and i was surprisingly happy how easy it is to order. i've ordered my wonderful faux fur the last weeks and i got it today. so everything went well and i've no critics to tell.. more great styles please!! I really love asos!
Ordered from NZ - within one week I had all delivered at the door
You will find numerous hair accessories for different types of hair. I got interested because they have ficcares in their product range (great hair clips from USA). If you don't know how to use the hair accessories Melissa Hill has produced several very interesting video clips you can see on Youtube. - Astrid from Germany
Fast shipment, good ordering process but the webside crashed several times during my shopping which was a little bit annoying for me. my shopping basket wasn't lost, so i could continue the ordering process but for a first time costumer i was not really sure wether this shop was 100% serious because of the unstable website. But in the end everything worked out really well and i will definitely order again at powermyself.com!
Good offer of hotels and very quick and easy to make the reservation!!!
From the first to the last contact this was professional and same time very friendly and helpful. The apartment was great, located in a non touristic place, as we wsihed, but near to everything we wanted to see in Barcelona I highly recommend this company and the friendly and professional staff
I purchased a "nearly new" Laney Ironheart IRT-STUDIO Studio Rack Tube Amp from g4m. Before doing so I double check what g4m defined as "nearly new" since I don't want to end up with beat up equipment. They're website clearly states; nearly new products look and work as new.  After waiting with great expectations for a couple of days, my girlfriend called me on 06.01.14 @ work to inform me the goods had arrived. Hurried home straight away, since I could not wait to try the amp. After unboxing the amp, I noticed straight away a big dent with the paint chipped off on the top right corner of the amp. I was quite disappointed since this is not what I consider "nearly new" looks clearly used & beat up. So instead of playing around with my new amp like I intended to do, I ended up spending the evening writing a complaints email to g4m. Since the box in which the amp arrived was in very good condition, it's not possible that this happened during transport. The damage is that bad that it's not possible that this could have happened without leaving traces on the box in which it was packed. It's not clear to who I should write the email, should it be the returns department, or customer service? So far no answer from g4m, as expected. They should really be ashamed of themselves for sending such a crappy beat up produkt to a customer for that price....this unit is not even worth half the price in this condition! UPDATE: Customer service department contacted me and gave me a couple of options: * I could keep the damaged device and get a part of the purchase amount refunded * I could send it back and get a brand new one * I could send it back and get the complete amount paid refunded I choose to send it back and get a new one. Decent customer service department, the person who'm I was in contact with spoke  and wrote decent English, so no communication problems whatsoever. It might take a day or two before you will get an answer on your mail, but once this happened they will handle it very fast and professional. Therefore I will change my rating from 1 to 5 stars.
good and quick service, car in a good and clean condition!
All fine with that. The key worked fine and i became it 2 days before release! Absolute perfect!
Easy order, easy payment, very quick delivery - and this all with a very good price!
Even when things went slightly wrong at first, AnyVan were there to help speedily. A very well organised company offering excellent and efficient service.
We have seen Bonni baby baby clothes in London, back in Germany we found the online shop and ordered twice - great pleasure!
Good and fast delivery of high-quality goods at competitive prices
thanks a lot for the stereo system for my scooter
Very fast delivery, great price - performance - I like to buy from you
I have once used the online version for making a photo book which was great. This time I downloaded the offline tool, and I must say, the offline version is not very user friendly. I was under extreme time pressure, as the voucher I bought had a deadline (which was only announced a week before expiring) and could do it only step by step on 2 or 3 consecutive days, I just wanted to be sure that the draft is still on my Macbook. The result was not great, I couldn't see a lot of things on the draft that appeared on the book, which I would have had amended, had I seen them on the screen.
If you order something on an Internet Shop you might expect that the good is availlabe and will arrive within 2-3 working days. Not so with Golfsupport.com. In my case, I had to wait about 2 month for nothing really Special. It was a bout some normal and very common golf shoes from Foot Joy size 9. To summarise: if you want to get a good price and you have plenty of time, so the time when the delivery will arrive, really doesn't matter - buy from Golfsupport.com - otherwise better not.
Ordered several times by now and delivery always happened instantly on the next working day! One time an item was out of stock and I right away received a call and was asked for an alternative choice. Really good experience dealing with those guys.
I ordered the golf bag and it lasts less than one week to send from the UK to Germany. The price was o.K. and i was was always informed abotu the purchase. i woulg recommend this company to anyone in germany
There are a number of trade-in companies out there that I have tried, and Ziffit is one of the better ones. Easy to use online tool (takes a bit of time to input ISBN etc.) and a numerous network of 'connect+' drop-off points for the box. They give you a choice of payment, including bank transfer and PayPal, which works much better and faster than cheques. Of course, they don't offer you much even for 'as new' items, or don't accept just about everything (but you can try other trade-in companies for those items, it pays to shop around and compare), but then their criteria for items' condition are fair. Ziffit asks you to put everything into one parcel, and their website suggests they would automatically determine the weight as they pick up anything weighing from 10kg. But even anything over 5kg gets bulky and uncomfortable to carry if you don't have a car to take the box to the drop-off points. That's probably the only issue I've had using them this time. Apart from that, using Ziffit was a very good experience and I'd do it again.
nice price, super fast delivery from UK to Germany, that's all I need :-)

I often do bookings via hostelworld.com and I am always satisfied with the handling. Never had any problems. Hostelworld gives a great overview and detailed information about the accommodations.
