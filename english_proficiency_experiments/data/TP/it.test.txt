We founded the apartament that we was looking for in only 3 days of searching.  Furthermore the site reminded us all the needed details about the booking and the owner contact data. We suggest this site to everyone.
Mine was the first order at Hifiheadphones, consisting of just a box of Comply replacement eartips. No problems, the product was the one I ordered, it was well packaged and it arrived in a short time (I live in Italy, it took 5 work days). Honestly this is what happened with many online stores, but what made Hifiheadphones stand out was the friendliness of its communications (also if I just received automated ones), the surprise of a little present I found when I received the package, and lastly their interest in my opinion about the service I received, asking me to come here and write my rating. In short I recommend Hifiheadphones not only because they do well their work but also because they do more than what they are supposed to do for the customers; this is uncommon and I believe Hifiheadphones deserves to be rewarded fot it.
Quick delivery and excellent packaging ! I will order again in the future !
Ho la linea telecom e mi trovo molto bene con tutti i loro servizi
The shop is perfect: every time you have a problem they help you, prices is good and the products is cheap but no shoddy. I would recommend this shop to you.
Fast and the envelopes we ordered are as we wanted. Great, i recommend this site.
Great selection of anything you may ever need for your fridge!
Fantastic service. I found what I was looking for without any hassle and received my key immediately upon payment.
I've tried a lot of Casinos in the past, but I was never really satisfied... Until I found 888casino. The site has got a pretty cool design and it's all easy to use, user-friendly and, moreover, the customer service is really great and helpful. I appreciated the variety of the games proposed and the fact that I found a lot of promotions.
wide availability of articles, sales service and warehouse organization. Perhaps it even more on some articles specify the characteristics and adaptability to your vehicle.
With Amoma.com you can find the best price of the hotel, at least for Italian hotel. It is very easy and quick to book the room. You have just to try.
I bought many different type of item in the store, wetsuits and surf accessories, and the quality is always the top. I found that very often wetsuit outlet have the lowest prices on web. Delivery have a very cheap cost and it is quick and good packed. I'll surely have many other deals with. Reccomended web store, the best!
very fast delivery and no problem during the order: higly raccomanded!
Well, let's say it's only a car, so if it goes and brings you where you have to go, it should do... But then again, I paid for it, so I'd expect to get something that's (really) in the line of what I ordered, and as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't! Of course having hired cars all over the world, I know that you almost never get the car that was presented to you during the reservation, the contract obviously makes it clear that you will get this car or something similar. The question is, who decides which cars are similar...???  From the reservation a VW gold or similar was the departure point.  And I really don't car if it wasn't a VW but going from a golf to a Kia Venga... Please...  So ok, I don't want to make a fuss about it, have little time (and they know that) so let's go with the venga.  Mmmmhhh... Is this really the same class as a VW Golf??? No way people, it isn't! If you have ever driven a Golf, you know it isn't, it doesn't even compare to the previous Golf model!  Ok, it's full of extras (GPS, controls on the steering wheel, cruise control, rear view camera, etc) but it's a toy, not a car. So, thinking I'll only live once, I go with it and leave... Stopping after some 30k's for a coffee, getting out of the car, I realise the tires are rather consumed... In a country where it rains some 70% of the year, I'd say that's rather dangerous... But the weather is fine, so they'll do I guess.  The weather is fine, that's right, so I go and open the window... Night is falling so I want to close it... Well, it took about 2 minutes to do so... Ok, so Europcar probably didn't know about that, so when I brought the car back, I told the man who checked my car about the window and the tires, big was my surprise to hear they already knew about these problems... So, if they knew about it, why didn't they solve these problems or give me a decent car? At least one with all weather tires, not with slicks! These problems are obviously to be attributed to Europcar. One thing I would want to say about eAutohuur.nl: during the reservation it wasn't at all clear that the car was NOT A DIESEL!! I made a fake reservation just to make sure it wasn't I who looked over it... YOU DON'T STATE THAT FACT ANYWHERE!! I think that's not fair at all, you should at least give your customers the choice to hire a car with a Petrol engine instead of Diesel!
MSP staff was very efficient and friendly, always ready to follow me throughout the sales process, from registration to the shipping management. They resolved quickly also a problem due to DHL. Great service and products that meet my needs.
I ordered thinking it would take a few dsys, and was nicely surprised when they turned up the day after. Great service
Abmbientedirect.com is a great online shop and I find my shopping experience was great and I intend to use them again - simply just because you get a quality product for much less than anywhere else with on time delivery with excellent customer service.
I red a review online about this service, and decided to give it try. Instant activation, so I had the possibility to try the service right after the payments. Servers are very fast. I also tried to send an email to their support, to see if the claims on their website were the truth. I got an answer after 53 minutes. If you have a new website to create you shoud give it a try, I strongly believe you won't be disapponted
Support, and Mining work is the best on the web at this time.
I found evolution slimming a very good site, where to order natural and weight loss products. Simply to use and very affordable prices!
The service is nice, I use it on a mac, and there is a dedicate app for connecting to the different server. Sometime, is very difficult to connect to same server, and you have to make several attempt before you can get a good server. It would be good if the application could identify the "free" server in advance. A function that the mac application is completely  missing, is that in case of server disconnection do not block all the internet connection, therefore, in case the service get disconnected, you start transmitting unencrypted data without any possibility to avoid it, and in same case, even without your knowledge. For IOS device there isn't an app that provide customs installation of the different VPN config, and to have several configuration in order to be ready to "catch" a server that is not overloaded, is very inconvenient, a custom app should be done.
I've only one problem with tracking number but the communication is great and i've solved all and i've received my knitwear. unfortunately i've received it after Christmas and it was a gift.
I'm very pleased with this exprerience; i will buy again from us,very fast shipping awesome better than any similar site who sell powders etc....can't stand versus bulkpowders in term of efficiency and quality
absolutely horrible! never seen a bad broadband like talktalk.. it makes me feel so nervous every time I use it! stay away from it!
Good and easy to go through the whole booing process
sometimes i've found broken pouch, and broken scoops. This is due to a non optimal package: no plastic chips, no paper chips, nothing to fill the spaces and adsorbe the hit that the ship will provide
Very good and professional service, nice, polite and hard-working team, I was really satisfied and so was my landlord when I gave him the keys at the end of tenancy. I will definitely recommend this company.
Truly i am very delighted and pleased with the espresso maker, it makes the best coffee i have ever  tried. Recommend to everybody, very fast and respectful service. Thank you very much.
Thought this was going to be compleated . It was a really smooth transaction. Really good
Too big... ebay gain too much money so they gone out of mind. The run to the lowest price and the high ebay/paypal fees set to ZERO the gain of small shops without a "power seller" account. I think ebay is OK for people who want to sell its old stuff, and people who want to buy new stuff at stockist price ....
I have had 9 sets of made to measure curtains from 24/7 and every one was very well made.  The first lot of curtains took a while to get to me hence 4 stars instead of 5, but it was in the lead up to Christmas so probably understandable. The second lot came within a week, so excellent service.  All enquiries were responded to extremely quickly and they were very helpful. I would certainly use again, and would definitely recommend.
A very speedy delivery, easy to use website and value for money.  I would recommend.
Lovely pair of gloves delivered very quickly. Nice leather and workmanship.
IMHO customer service very friendly, quick and very clear relationship
great addictive site. you can logging for find your old friends and makes new contatct possible. very useful for your work/company too.
customer service friendly and useful. and the service is fast and very very good. i'm finding fine.
IMHO since many times geizhals is a very good price comparator.
I ordered a jacket in size XS but was sent a size S. Customer service was quick to reply to my email but with unclear information and directions. I have to pay for the shipping and then I may or may not be reimbursed for it... I find that very disappointing since the company is at fault. THEY should pay for the return shipping without a doubt. I don't think I'll be ordering from this merchant again, not unless they improve their service.
I have placed an order for a Go Pro Hero 3 Plus Black Edition oblate night the 2nd of May, I received the tracking number as I could follow the shipping. It departed on 5th of May from HK and the courier knocked at my door just after 2 days ! Better than expected ! Very good wrapping and packing to avoid damages! Competitive prices and choice ! Excellent service from EglobalCentral ! Thank you very much !
my wear arrived in the time established, good quality of all product that i have bought
I bought a Quick Mill Andreja Premium from italy-outlet.com. Their price was good but since I hadn't done business with them earlier I hesitated a bit. I decided to email some questions and I got quick responses, so I placed my order. Everything went well, I received emails when the product was shipped with a tracking number so I could follow the transportation. I had a question after the purchase, having misplaced my invoice for the book keeping which I emailed and asked for a copy, even this email, not regarding a new sale, was promptly answered.
I bought a lot of Cd-Keys in this web-site! They arrived soon and they worked perfectly!
The product was as I expected, the shipping fast without problem and when I was searching for some clarification, the customer service was prompt and fullfilling. I'm buying from Italy and I had no problem at all, at any stage of the order. Overall very good shop.
I would recommend this online shop to anyone looking for golf equipment. They are fast, efficient, competent and extremely reliable, in addition to being very friendly on the telephone!
I've travelled many times with Ba, but seats are small and service on average. I had many problems with delayed baggage. But they are very kind and they will help you.
I find Ebay getting more and more expensive, so if I find a less expensive method to sell my things, I will do it.
quick delivery and a customer service very kind and ready to solve any kind of problem
I order from Italy amd my order always arrives in 5 days time or even less!!! The quality is exellent and at a very good price!
Reliable and fast. Not the best prices ever but has often very good deals!
Me and my friends found many errors on the guide, perhaps 'because we visited London during the olimpic games, some places were closed, we lost too much time of our travel, and the London pass office not informed us about many changes in those days. Considering the price and the time of validity of the London pass it was not a gain, we could have pay the same amount, but paying the single ticket of each one place and doing everything with more relax.
great and very very fast service.... i found all solution for my needs.
I've found site very well done, easy to navigate in and to find items I was looking for. The price for the item(s) I purchased was very competitive, and all the procedures (payment etc) have been fast and easy to complete, and my parcel have been shipped in a very fast time.
First time was: Good stuff, fast delivery, good price.  In my opinion the delivery costs are a bit too high (15 pounds to deliver to Italy). If I buy for more then 50 pounds of goods others eshop send items for free. Second time: they told me that tried another way to send items through Post Office...lets say that it wasn't a good idea as I received the items after 1 month! I have also to recognize that they have recognized the error and apologize both via email and via phone, this show me their commitment on customer care. I think I'll give them another chance maybe was only and accident....let's see next time!
Very good prices. good choice of products and good delivery time. Only one remark, for people who buys in euro, watch out thet the currency conversion form Pound to euro declared on the site is not the true one. You have to look an official web site to have the exact final price in euro.
What can i say..... Very fast delivery, the item was in perfect condition i am very palesa ed to have bought at this company
We booked a Villa in Tuscany for 1 week. The place was excellent and the price very good. Easy booking and good customer service.
Serious, fast and reliable. I left it to the online store and I found what I could not find in Italy, my country. Fast delivery, promise what they say. Will purchase again.
I finaly found the DEFINITIVE shop to buy my supplements.. if U search for a supplment name it and myprotein has it.. really competitive prices and excellent products quality..  I will never buy elsewere! ;)
I received my gift key in one day. Maybe you shold send an email when the key is available in the account page.
I don't like to waste my freetime so it's pretty important to tell you to STOP lookin' on other website! PREDATORNUTRITION is the BEAST! no doubt! fast, clear & rapid to answer me everytime i've wrote the staff! That's it!
I think this is the most complete site you can find on web, the customer service is also very efficient. I always received answers to my questions and yesterday after only 10 minutes!
Ive started buying shoes on an internet site and found they were always sent from Bellsshoes, so I decided to contact them personally by phone and order directly from them. Their site is great so all I did was phone, give the order number, specify I was in a hurry as I was going on holiday give cc. details  and that was it! They arrived by post in 5 days, just in time to take away with me. I live in Italy and have problems finding big sizes, so now my problem is solved added to which I now have a vast choice. I'd definitely reccommend to anyone buying over the net, go to Bellsshoes you'll be very pleasantly surprised.
Choose, pay and wait only few minutes for your purchase!
I ordered my yellow lumia 1520 on 17th of December, 2013. I knew, from a very clear message on the site, that it was not possible to receive the phone before Christmas. I placed the order at 12:14 p.m. and payed via Skrill. I also gained an upgrade for the prioritary delivery without any due payment. The package (my yellow windows phone nokia lumia 1520) was delivered on 23rd of December, 2013 in perfect status. The package itself was very well done in a trasparent, plastic.... basket. Also the price was very interesting: Euros 559. I think I will do others affairs with Valuebasket.com.
I'm very satisfied about a difficult issue which I have not felt alone thanks to the caring availability guaranteed by WiEro very worried and did not know what to do ... Andrea helped me promptly responding to my concerns promptly and heart ... Thank you so much Andrea .. You can count on me!...
With my last order I had the chance to receive a BCAA pack for free, thanks to a promotional code. I filled it in the right template and the P.O. listed the BCAA pack together with the other items I bought. However, after sending out the P.O, I noticed that in the effective items list, BCAA were missing. I wrote you therefore asking to modify the P.O. within 30 mins from P.O. issue, but no reply from you. The day after, I was informed that once a P.O. is issued there is no chance to modify it. I have therefore gone back to my original supplier that never made happen such displeasant episodes.
simply the best in farmaceutical grade supplements...one could basically live off my protein products...they have whole foods, drinks, and all the range of supplements needed for sports and bodybuilding...if u don' t find it on the site it must be really rare...i buy a lot of supplements and the only thing i didnt find there is TTA ...best prices in europe by the way.... for a basic gym supplement package like creatine, whey, and a preworkout like arginine 60 euros and you' re done.... 1 kg creatine 10 euros, the best whey i have ever tried 20 euros, and AAKG 22 euros...shipment only 6 euros if you spend less than 100 otherwise it' s free.....KEEP IT UP MP...will be buying from you forever !

Because is one of the best online shop that I know. Amazing!!!
I am a registered Customer of Arcapel in Italy. Beginning of current year (2013) I bought a GSM Camera, later on determined to be a V900-B2 model (no brand, model or whatsoever is indicated in the manual - very poor documentation supplied with the product!). Recently, so well within the 1 year warranty time of Hong Kong (Home base of Arcapel) I attempted the installation, using a GSM SIM Card of Operator TIM Italy, making sure the configuration parameters are correct (at least according to what it could be found on the web). Unfortunately, the device still fails to work correctly, thus with mail 1623 30/08/2013 to support@arcapelshop.com (re-sent 03/09/2013 12:34) I submitted a detailed description of the problem. As at today (14/09/2013) I have no reply and I am considering the return of the good.
...but it is not anymore. All the fees and charges are ridicoulus, not to mention the noise and all those advertisements during the flights..
Optimal reviews around the web made me wonder how the services worked I live in Europe but have a few Import titles from US because getting the correct ENGLISH / JAPANESE language BD Game for PS3 is sometimes impossible in Europe Ended up ordering the 10$ PSN card to get a desired game from the US store and it worked like a charm Paid the price given on the site, awaited 5 minutes for clearance verification and got the PSN code in my order review; activated it on the PSN right away and got my desired game downloaded in a couple of Hours (2 GB :D ) All nice and smooth Loved it and will probably use it again in the near future
Really astonished by the growth of this brilliant social network on a side and the fast-paced company behind it on the other side. Congratulation!
By far the best value for money school of english you can find on the web!! It really was a very very positive experience even though I initially was skeptical.
This was my first order I found myself very well ... reliable and fast in shipping the next purchase!
I bought several time, always received a very good service
I've received my brand new Shure SE425 headphones in a short time (6 days from the online order until receive it at my home including weekend) without any problem saving about 30% compared to online prices here in italy. I would like to recommend eGlobal Central Europe to any european customers as well. Thank you for your services. Manuel (Brescia-Italy)
Great Order!! Since i paid for it i had to wait for less than two minutes to redeem my key, everything went smooth
From my opinion, it's the best way to discover London
888games is the best online casino that I've ever found! Payments are really fast and secure, and you can play with a lot of nice games.
Are about 3 years that I play on online casino, but everyone promise a lot of thing and no one gives you anything.....except 888casino! This is the best casino online I've ever found! Nice, fun and with secure payments!
A great seller! It was a pleasure buy from you :)
Very clear billing and checkout system , fast shipment, only 1 day to get my purchase.
I booked for the second time an hotel in Italy through this website because they had offered me a good rate. I need the invoice so the cost would be repaid me by my employer. The hotels had refused to issue it (in my opinion wrongly) because the money had been taken from onhotels, so I requested the document to the site. Unfortunately, like some other members at Trustpilot complain, the first time onhotels sent the invoice only after have been reading my review on trustpilot, but this time I'm still waiting. Now their behavior is clear ..
The pack was dispatched to Italy (I'm Italian) and however all was perfect: very fast delivery, good package and excellent products at fair prices. I do recommend to everyone, even out of UK.
Item shown as available in their website was actually not available; however, it came within a couple weeks with no problems.
Fast and reliable. You can trust this sellers. Support center fast and they always reply to your questions. I bought 2 copies of Grid 2 in pre-order. 1 month early. They sent me the serial a day before. Always check the website for new offers!
Hello everyone, I'm desperate, is a month that I ordered raspberry ketone but still I got nothing ... I'm sending out emails every day, but I don't receive any response.Help I don't know what to do :(
I found Zoorate fantastic for the value proposition: on Zoorate you find product reviews to help your purchase decisions, ok. But most of all you can profile yourself and Zoorate filters reviews and ratings to show the most appropriate for your taste and preferences!
Besides being a very important marketing channel to reach targeted audience, commercial representatives are really superficial in terms of peculiar opportunities discussions.
I bought many clothes on oasap because they are cute and excellent quality. Shipping is fast and go oasap is like buying a shop open 24 hours over 24 in a cheerful and colorful world
A new job search, millions of job listings from all over the world !!!!
The whole process, from asking questions, till the delivery was very easy and friendly. The staff assist me promptly while I've experienced a wrong size item. I'm very happy, and for sure I will buy again.
The car arrived on time and the driver was very nice. As promised on the ad, the driver also loaded all the luggage at the entrance of the airport. I'd recommend the service!
i a m verry happy i have a Vibox pc,and the assistance are verry fast to helping with any problem about pc,thanks a lot VIBOX
I found many threads that I think should be removed, I don't think that reviews are genuine on there.
I think this is a bad website because it seems to protect some ecommerce website, I don't think that all of the comment are genuine.
my money have been deducted from the credit card but they requested me another payment
Your website has grown a lot in the past few years and it has become really awsome! It offers an incredibly wide range of products and competitive brands (I hope one day also Chanel will appear among them), not to mention the great price discounts you periodically offer! I am very satisfied with your customer service as well, always efficient and caring (little free samples you add to the package are always a very nice treat!). All in all you managed to make online shopping a smooth and pleasant experience :-) One last comment I would like to leave is about the shipping costs. Maybe you could consider prividing free shipping for orders over a certain amount. That would be fantastic and highly appreciated :-) Thank you for everything! xxx
Unparalleled versatility and flawless operation, runs on any platform and even in the cloud. High quality output and countless range of skins available, you can even create your own.
Perfect shirt and excellent service from the shop,  I highly recommend you buy at this store because it has items and excellent service and quality brands.
Perfect advice, fast delivery as well as kindness in short, that you will definitely buy some business. advice
Service was extremely good and the product arrived swiftly and lives up to all expectations. The Ice Cream is of supreme quality.
An perfect software for realization your album for webpage. The license is connection with your account and is not necessary insert the code in the program but is sufficient log-in with your account in the software. The license permit use the program without the banner in your album.
Prompt delivery and accurate package. All the items met the requirements as descibed on the web site. I recommend this site to everyone who need cycling parts.
I've bought a set of formula's T1 and a shimano's chainring, overall very good and polite communication and fast trackable spedition to italy. Ah..... have i already told you what amazing price? :)
I have booked a hotel in New York through easytobook, and by looking at customers' experiences, and I could make just the right choice: a perfect combination between price and quality! so I strongly recommend to use this tool to book hotels anywhere in the world, reliable, easy and quick! Paola
Usually purchasing accessories is not so convenient when you buy abroad (I'm from Italy, while QuietPC.com is UK-based): but this is not the case of QuietPC.com, which has a broad stock inventory, often a competitive pricing on most of items, and above all which takes care of each and every customer regardless of the total amount spent. Definitely a shop highly recommendable, wherever your're buying from!
Hostel bookers the Best No booking fee.. and is also possible to read the review in real time.. theyalways send you an e mail the day that you live the Hostel that you booked.. so all the other travellers can read them... I will never change Hostelbookers
Product(s) arrived after two days from order:very fast..DHL has improved,hopefully they will continue.Before they were almost hopeless, at least here in Italy. One battery did not fit,was 1 mm larger in diameter. Rather than asking for service in guarantee, I preferred to grind off the surplus.Not a dealer's  fault: imputable to Basch,who gave me other problems ,in the past, always with their batteries.. I would recommend Batronix for precise and extremely fast service.
People in the Company are very friendly and cooperative.Price is very reasonable.Some problem has been found in the site, which did not  work properly and  caused difficulties in selecting the lenses,but the malfunction has been quickly corrected. If it were not for a misunderstanding from a person of the staff,who did not identify properly the lenses I had chosen ,which prompted her to write me a pretty confusing e-mail, the rest of the service has been impeccable.The glasses arrived  ,in spite of a three day delay due to said misunderstanding, within one week of my order. Courier was very efficient . Pity I could not get an approximate time span for  consignment, which  made  my wife stay home waiting   practically the whole day.All in all ,however, I am very happy with my glasses and would highly recommend FashionEyewear
I was afraid I could have problems buying an expensive guitar on the internet, but everything was ok, fast shipping and a perfect guitar. I'd recommend this company to anyone.
I raccomend to everybody to give a look first to this shop because there you ken found what do you like.......
Either the delivery and product are fine,  but the manual which come with the product is too short,  on the other hand the one on the Web Page of the product is complete and clear. The product is well made and for the same fuctions you have to pay a lot more in similar products.
It is a pleasure to do shopping with customised bikes!Best value products,fast shipping and a great customer care! Thank you very much!
I checked the date of expiration of my new box of protein bars (mybar high pro) and I discovered that under the first label there was a second one with an expiration data of 11 month before. It's absolutely not acceptable, and NOT LEGAL!
I've been a member of this social network since early 2008. Even though it offers the impression of helping your sociality, in reality it can destroy it. Pretty much the same effect of cocaine (even though the latter is probably less addictive)!!
No reservation, the deal was managed very efficiently and rapidly, customer satisfied.
Flowers were beautiful and on time! The woman that received the bouquet had a really nice surprise and was very happy! She told me even that somebody from FloraQueen called her  the day after to ensure that everything was ok... so... nothing to add!!! I'm very satisfied and would recommend this!
I purchased from merlin shimano components to a very advantageous price with free shipping, need to come back to serve from them
I've been using British Corner Shop for a few years now and I'm always happy and well satisfied with the fast and efficient service they provide. The site is easy to use and my orders always arrive on time... if not early. The packaging is well done and everything always arrives in pristine condition. I really don't know what I would do without this site to keep me supplied with my favourite English foods.
it is always a pleasure to order at CULT PENS. they are great.
It was very easy to find the product we need. Information on product was complete and very clear. It was easy to complete the purchase with no difficulties. We hope to receive the same high-standard service in case of insurance claim
My first review was suspended without reason! I really don't think it violated any TrustPilot rule! I tried to re-edit with no success. I'm waiting for an answer
I purchased a canon lens, the price was a bargain, no additional spending or tariffs. Needless to say, I am fully satisfied and I can recommend anyone Eglobal.
It's my 1st buy from MilletSports, through eBay, and I'm really satisfied. Their choice is from good quality brands. In addition items on sale are really a bargain. You get savings in comparison to prices of any other similar shop, even adding the shipping costs (and consider that I live in Italy, so shipping is more expensive than for UK). Bonus: wide choice of models / colors / sizes, accurate description of items available, very fast shipping, return policy, good customer support service. So... keep the bookmark of their site because it will save you money and time.
I wrote to them several times and they replied every time on short time, giving proper info. There was a problem during the purchase but they solved very well with my full satisfaction. I recommend this shop to everyone.
Really no comment, it is what I was looking for. I would re-buy the next time
In February 2013 I did pre-order unblocking of 2 U.S. Sprint iPhone 4S, after a few days saying that the release was available, asked how much I paid for the release, but even after many of my reminders, emails, phone calls, to date I have not never had any response, no release, no refund, as I have asked many times. We are talking about € 300.00 I REPEAT, I DO NOT HAVE NEVER ANSWERED. WARNING P.S. sorry but I speak bad English Hello, I'm still writing and still not satisfied, the 'October 8, as your instructions, I have posted on Vs. site, all my bank details for the refund, but still I have not received any refund nor any response from you to my request for information.
I looked at their website, I chose the products, I contacted them by email, they sent me the quote, I paid and in a few days they sent me the material. Personally, I was very satisfied
The first time i bought tyres on an online shop was Oponeo. Their service was great and the price was awesome. For this price I could expect some problems but everything went well.
Great price, quick shipment, kindness in responding to my questions, timeliness of information provided to me about the status of the shipment.
Very nice store, well-stocked, never seen before So many high quality products in a easy handy website Customer service highly professional and fast to response. They had a small delay with my order, and they sent me a presents for the trouble! In one word: Fantastic! Recommended
It is the best Casino shop I've ever seen. Awesome on line casino shop where I can purchase all products of casino. I like this app very much. Easy to download, easy to use and very reliable.
I bought the garcinia cambogia from Top-nutrition.co and I can say that it really worth all the money that it cost. Their garcinia is helping me losing weight and suppress my appetite and in 2 months of use I lost around 8kg! Pro of their Garcinia Cambogia + great ingredients + great customer support + fast delivering + it really works to lose weight Less of their Garcinia Cambogia - Price is a little above average but worth all the money it costs
Guys this is a great site, yes the delivery can be very slow sometimes but imagine how many people order some coins and anyway its the cheapest site ive found and reliable because youll get your coins eventually:)
Well agree with many others they are quite long in delivery but I bought a Celine bag and save 450.00 € from retail price!! That's wonderfull bag. Thank FashionQueen I will be back soon (after my next month salary!!!)
I made an order late at night, the next day in the morning it was out and gotten to its destination in the promised 1 working day. It seems this company doesn't like to make you wait, and when it's about my contacts I like it that way. They also have a big selection, you can be sure you will find a product you like.
Got a key from them very quickly, their customer service had almost immediate replies. I had an issue with my order and they tempestively fixed it, so if you're looking for very low priced keys from a safe and responsive seller, Gamerkeys is an easy choice. Will definitely buy again.
I've only purchased one item from mareshop but it arrive on time and worked as expected.  I am waiting for them to get additional merchandise in stock so I can make further purchases.  Their prices can seem a bit too good to be true.
I would recommend this company to anyone wishing to buy  pens or green whiteboard markers and staff like that. I will place more more orders in the near future and the delivery costs to Italy are convenient.
as they sayd i've got my battlefield 4 EU (with ITA ) version in time and i'm preloading it :) serious company !!
i bought a prepaid card EU for FFXIV and was instantly delivered :) i'll use this site again
Brought a key and instatly delivered perfectly and more economic than others :) i'll buy from this site again
I think this is THE WORST SERVICE I EVER used to buy keys....I brought a DLC key on this site and payed with PAYPAL (fortunately) and waited as all the time....this kind of transaction usually takes 1 days not more....after 2 days I started to write their customer service and on their Skype account. They answered only on the skype asked the order and told they was sending keys right now so i waited again......That was the last time I had a responde from them because every 30minutes i wrote a mail and asked for more detail on skype but no answer come back. When tired to wait i opened a contestation with PAYPAL and had to wait 6days to convert that to refound and i wrote the last message that was still ignored. PAYPAL gaves me reason for no sending the object . So.......This site is a SCAMMING system and should be shutted down....I agree with the other review: they take your money and disappear and i heard that some guys had received a key but ALREADY USED so paypal in that case can't refound you so WATCH OUT and BE CAREFUL. There are a lot of serious site and this is not one of them....and i usually buy online....That was the worst service I ever had. Sorry if some things are incomprehensible but i'm trying to write in english :) seriously don't buy from them
a very good shop, it's like a family. Always friendly and fast shipping. excellent customer service
I pay my shoes in 5/5/13 , in august i haven' t notice. After many qustions they say to me i have required refound. I choosed a coupon, i' m waiting an answers since then how to' used it !!!!!! Be careful!!!!!
Just ordere 100gr of NAC, my order arrived in time and in perfect state. Very good and reliable service, some items are a bit expensive but the quality is good so in some cases the hight proce is worth.
The service is good shipping fast enough! But there is a problem I have sold a product with damaged package ..... not done attention!
I will write a very short review because I don't master English language... Just to say I'm happy about WebTogs since my parcel was delivered fast, all went ok . I would buy again from this site.
Many articles, with exhaustive and correct descriptions. Web site easy to use, good prices and very quick delivering.
I found iUSB Port mini product at a good price, everything ok with the order and with shipping, satisfied!
very unhappy. very slow and the products are not specified properly. also too slow in shipping methods.
I really suggest to use this site as it is probably the quickest and safest cd key store so far, good prices and staff.
Twice I had issues with vendors and never get back my money from PayPal. The advertising is teasing but it is not providing what promising!!! Be aware of this when use it!!!
Excellent service, quick delivery and package well prepared. Top that with the quality of the goods and you will have a very hard time topping it. Keep up the good work!
I found this site 4-5years ago and Made alot of orders.all The goods arrived in time and perfect!! I have to Say that Lookfantastic.com is a one site that you can trust and be' sure when you Shop on-line!!
I was very pleased to receive my hats today, they are even better than what I expected from the pictures on the site.  Colours are not too bright, which I prefer. Size L/XL fits perfectly (I was worried it could be too big - my size being 57.5 cm). Very efficient and reliable service even on an international delivery. Bravo!
I received the item I ordered but it took quiete a long time (13 days from UK to Italy). What I didn't like was they didn't send me any email confirmation including tracking details once the parcel was dispatched.
I placed the order and paid by wire-transfer. I received the goods (2 lens) in less than 1 week without any issue. The package was great and the lens in perfect conditions. Communication with Ana and Olivier is always quick & smooth. They are nice people, always doing their best to assist you with any issues (payment, tracking numbers, information about shipment and so on). For sure I will buy from this shop in future!
I'm very satisfied about every aspect of the service. The customer care guy was really kind, the service was perfectly on time and the gift surprisingly amazing!
My order arrived on time and everything was in good condition. What more could you ask for?
I find almost everything I need for my Land Rover and shipments are fast and relatively cheap
The customer service in Italy is the worst I have ever experienced in my life!! I usually purchase my tickets on the airlines' website; but this time, a friend of mine recommended me this site. I was almost losing more than 1500 euros because an unprofessional customer service representative (apparently there is only 1 person in Italy dealing with telephone calls and e-mails - her name is Chiara) was insisting that only the airline company could have solved my problem. Even though I discovered through Air France that every travel agent has a direct number for Air France assistance, Mrs Chiara did not even try to call this number. She was only good at keeping me on the phone at 32 cents per minute and telling me the same wrong information as a recorded message! It was a real nightmare!!! For your well being, AVOID THIS WEB SITE
When someone asks me about the best customer service I have ever experienced, my answer is: AMERICAN EXPRESS. I always use their cards also online as I feel protected regardless the various threats on the web.
this site could still improve as visibility and as an organization of the topics, I hope will be taken overhauled.
i buy donkey kong for wiiu at only 27£ best price on the net.
4 days of waiting to receive the screen, montanto in 15 minutes and works perfectly.
Juast as I said theyr product were perfect and delivery has benn very fast in Italy. The only thing I've something to say about is the price, but they tell it to you!
After two weeks, one of the 100W daylight bulbs I ordered stopped working because of a manufacturing fault. One e-mail later, and a new one is on my doorstep F O C. Ten out of ten. Many Thanks, Steve.
I have told so many of my friends about travelex, and now they all use it
I had my first tattoo last week and it had been a really pleasant experience that I would like to share. The tattoo artist was really clear and explained me everything on the phone while we were getting the agreement and also along the process. He took his time to make the design perfect according to my instructions. The place was really clean and quiet. During the whole process he asked me how I felt, if I needed a break and in general he took care of me, especially because it was my first tattoo. He also respected all the changes I made about the colors during the inking process. The tattoo resulted even better than on paper. I can say that I will definitely go back to the Uptown INK for my second tattoo and I would also recommend it to my friends!
Hello, I want share with all my very positive experience with WORLDREMIT, since I have discover it I use only this way for send money to my girlfriend in Kenya!! I find this service very easy, fast , safe and not much expensive!! Also sometime I can send money while I am on holiday there as I cantacted customer care that is very fast in answer and allow me to send/receive the money (as they saw that was sended from another country that the one in what I am signed)!! So it's really WONDERFUL IN ALL Bye. Danilo
Just bought several times from pb and their service has been nearly to perffect, except for samples; you can buy 500+ pound of supps, but they never send you just one little sample!! That's not that good. I'll continue to buy from them just coz they got a very good customer service and they've never fault with me.
Easy access to the site, good prices and service perfect sale
Totally unreliable. I preordered a copy of Diablo 3 three weeks before release date, it was in stock. Near the launch day they started reassuring customers that they would send all the  keys of preordering customers BEFORE midnight so that we can play at launch. They said: "The games are arriving via courier so we cannot predict exactly what hour and minute they will arrive but we can definitely guarantee that the keys will be sent on 14th May" "We expect to fulfill orders from people who pre-ordered the game today" (14th May) They repeated these things on their facebook page until one hour before Diablo 3 launch on 00.01 15-05-2012. Sorry to say that I haven't recieved any key before this time as promised. And the same happened to hundreds of other customers, just look at their facebook page, hoping that they haven't deleted all the bad comments. Don't give them any money. Totally unreliable. I've paid a preorder and get the cd-key after non preordering people that have bought it at blizzard online store. Very disappointing. I'll never, never buy again from them. ps. Probably they'll answer this review trying to justify themselves. Don't trust them. I've warned you people. EDIT: They tried to justify themselves as expected. The fact is that they modified the product page on 14th may and changed the expected delivery time. They also deleted all the comments I've quoted from theyr facebook page. Fortunately in another review there are screenshoots proving what they promised. In the end what really makes me angry is not the fact that I couldn't play on midnight, but the fact that they lied to me all the time. If you would have said in the afternoon that you weren't able to fulfill all the requests, I would have cancelled my order and bought it at another store but I would have never left you a negative review because you would have been sincere and at least somewhat professionals.
Ordered Titanfall, had my key within 1 minute, very fast and secure as always
I'm fully satisfied of this company. I bought a game from Italy and the experience has been perfect: fast delivery, good package and efficient custom service. 5/5
I had a few pieces of gold jewellery, which I did not wear at all, and I uploaded it on this website, to be honest i was not entirely sure what to think about it. But in a couple of minutes, not more the 15 minutes i received a quote. Items was picked up, only had to pack them and print a label. A couple of days later i received a phone call from a friendly lady, who explained me that the value of one item was changed because the items was a lot lighter then they assumed.  At first i was disappointed, but she explained to me everything, and i decided not to sell this item for this lower price, and the ring was sent back to me. No problems at all! For the other items the money was booked  in my account quick. I would probably use this service again.
Service is good overall, could be a bit more accurate from time to time, but i can recomend this provider
Ordered from amazon uk, order was quick, delivered and packaging was good
It is the first time I buy glasses from this company, and I have to say that this company has a great organization and competitivenes on prices. For my next purchases will be my first choice. I highly recommend it.
I placed an order to be shipped to Italy. Costumer service contacted me the next day to check with me the international shipping fees and the delivery was super-fast! Excellent!
tutto ok a b c d e f g h i l m n o
Nothing to say very quick to respond. Just to answer your question. I'm waiting for products that do not come to me. Too much time for shipping.
The products are as described. Fast Shipment. It could help to have an english version of the website
Items received with a little delay due to Xmas holidays but very well packed and in perfect conditions. After sales service very polite and very fast in giving you an answer. Really suggested
They cannot even write a cheque accurately. They agreed to write a cheque to my marathon running friend so she could add it to her charity funds. THEY AGREED TO MAKE IT PAYABLE TO 'x' Three months later ( YES, THREE MONTHS!!!) she receives a cheque made payable to us. CRAP,CRAP, Crap company.......................unbelievable awful. 30.01.14 Interesting that my e mails to customer services and consumer services seem to get ignored but postings on trustpilot get a response. I have had an apology for the complete cck up that has taken hours of my time and years off my life. I have also been offered a payment of 50 quid - less most of the 26 quid I don't owe them (ie.30 pounds compensation - roughly a quid a minute of my time). I call that derisory and insulting. I have asked them to pay it to www.giftaid/hannahmcneil1 - a friend who is running the London marathon and raising money for guide dogs for the blind. What's the betting I get a useless sterling cheque sent to me in Eurozone Italy where I now live????? To First Direct customer service advisors....have you though of applying for jobs with e.g. an ombudsman service or similar? You have a completely thankless job and it is only FUs appalling telephone enquiry service that saves you from being yelled at hourly. Get a real job, I suggest! Transferred electricity and Gas to First Utility early 2012. Rang a month or so later to ask why gas hadn't transferred and was told it had gone to another company (?). Moved to Italy in June so cancelled contract. Received bill including 30 quid or so for Gas. Rang, was told they had the gas supply for one week (contradicted their last statement). Intended to raise a complaint but had too much else to do. Asked for repayment of the outstanding credit. Received in in November - by cheque (which is great as I live in Italy). Just got a e mail bill for 400 pounds plus for Gas???????? I have no contract with them, they did not supply gas, they DO NOT ANSWER QUERIES RAISED for weeks at a time. Crap company. REALLY CRAP
There was plenty of choice, it was easy to place the order, the delivery was in time. The perfect customer experience.
I found a very quick and friendly solution to my problem. Thank you again
A friend suggested me to buy lenses on eglobal central and so I tried. So far I bought two lenses and a memory card. It takes quite a few days to receive the goods, but you know it when you place the order with standard service. Goods come on time, in perfect state and they do cost much less if compared to other websites. I strongly raccomend it!
good prices good customer services good quality and THIRD PARTY coa shipping costs: A little expensive
i found this site very professional either during a meeting in Germany for business and now for family ! The idea to publish the rating given by the users is fundamental
The ticket was really cheap and good value for money. When I wanted to do a route change after the ticket was issued the help desk was not very supportive. I had to do it all myself, luckily Swiss (LX) was very helpful.

I always enjoy flying with Ryanair especially because I spend much less than with other companies and their flights leave from an airport 5 minutes from my home so...... how easy can that be? It's great to fly to and from London directly from my  home town. Dear Ryanair, please add new flights from Parma! Merry Christmas and a happy New Year to all at Ryanair!
I've been using paypal for 3 years now and I've never once had a problem. I do online shopping on a regular basis and it's great to be able to use a safe payment method 24/7. Very well done to all at Paypal and...... I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a peaceful and prosperous New Year.
I wish I invented Google! Not only because I'd be extremely rich but because it's a fantastic invention. What a great search engine it is. It's easy to use and the grafic is nice. The links are in the correct order (most important first). Of course, you have to write the correct key words.
on their website you will find everything you need quickly and with clear and easily understandable, the handing over is quick and their prices are cheap
Im a perfume's fancier and i'm always searching for fragrances i don't find in my country (Italy ). I've buyed many times by Fragrancedirect . (I have find the most UK perfumes websites DON'T SHIP to European countries.. ) You sure must have PATIENCE to receive the parcel, (it travels by land!) but is not their guilt!  At least they don't resign themselves to RESTRICTIONS caused by changes in Regulations introduced by the AAT!!! (before these changes they delivered me an order by signed AIRMAIL into few days). The products are all good quality items and the prices are very affordable. I will buy again.
I was very satisfied with the treatment, very good prices and no shipping costs. Very good, I recommend
My criticism is towards the delivery and the time it took, not for the quality of the product which i haven't yet tried. 12 days....and box full of bumps, product is ok. Customer service replies a few days after my e-mail and blames it completly on the delivery service. Customer service cannot find my street number on the delivery note (they are actually shipping to Italy where i live, i'm not really sure how that works, but if u don't have a street number u  can't deliver it! They give me a phone number to put in a complaint and that is an office somewhere in Northwich (I am still living in Italy) but nobody answers. I had to contact myself the delivery company to get it delivered! POOR service!
My third game card for FF XIV eu Bought after 3 months, still the best place at the best price with istant delivery ;)
fast shipping and god quality of the product, perfect! will buy again
I really like using the site Hostelworls because it aloows my friends and I to travel all around the world and save money which we can spend on having local fun.
I live in the UK but I come from Italy, so sometimes I need to transfer Euros and get them converted to Pounds. Transferring through my UK bank means getting a significant amount of money lost in hidden fees, and that's simply wrong. With Transferwise, I now have my Euros converted to Pounds at the best exchange rate possible, and the transfer is very quick as well! I couldn't but recommend this service!
I love how Top Croise Deals is made. I found a perfect deal for my vacation last month. All was perfect. I will use this site again.
I need some products that I could not find and I needed it fast. I took only 2 clicks to get home what I was looking for in a short time. I recommend everyone this service
Olotels is cheap, easy and convenience booking website. Very interesting bonus program: for each booking you can earn discount points for the next reservation...great idea!!
So you've made a decision on the headphones you're going to buy... you've then got to find the right place to buy them... look no more, these guys not only offer the best price (including postage), but they dispatch with lighting speed and your goods arrive in one piece, thanks to some excellent packing; oh, and the headphones, in this price range are tough to beat, they are quite simply superb.
If not kings of Chesterfield, they are most certainly 'kings' of sending one of their 'Luxury Beer Starter Kits' to Turin in north Italy!  I ordered on-line on a Monday and by lunch-time on the Friday I had the included real ale beer kit in the fermenting bucket!  Very nice, thank you. No more Italian larger for me! And when this lot's done I'll be back on-line for another order. Great quality starter kit, lightning fast delivery and a great web site full of useful information. Complimenti! as they say here in Italy, from a now very happy Englishman abroad.
I'm a big fan of holiday apartments when I travel especially with my friends and with my family. I have been using several websites so far and I've discovered Apartum. Just a great website where you can see almost all apartments available in a city or a region. Just brilliant! By the way: the heat map feature is just amazing! I found the most touristic place in a second and the best place where to stay
Nowhere else in the UK can match Merlin on components. I usually pick stuff up from here and get the LBS to fit the stuff I can't do myself. Postage has always been super quick.
I purchased a Specialized mountain bike from the Tredz site back in February as they were a hundred quid cheaper than anywhere else for the same model at the time. After a few delays with dispatch the bike arrived well-packed and ready to ride. Unfortunately at the start of June I started having issues with the rear freehub so called Specialized directly to enquire about the problem. They informed me that that particular model of freehub had been discontinued due to issues with them and to get in touch with the bike shop I bought it from to put in a warranty request. I emailed Tredz but they passed the buck straight away and told me to take it to a local bike shop to diagnose the problem. Straight away alarm bells started ringing. I took it to a local store who were unable to help, as they said Specialized warranty requests had to go through the original store. I got back in touch with Tredz but this time I was a little more aggressive with them and they agreed to take a look at the hub. By the end of June Tredz informed me that Specialized had sent out a new wheel and they'd be sending this direct to me. I hadn't heard anything for a couple of weeks so called the warranty department directly who told me that unfortunately they'd 'sold' the replacement wheel and had to order me a new one. They eventually sent one out, completely the wrong size (my bike is a 26er, they send a 29er) without any rim tape and with incorrect axle caps. I must have called their warranty department over 15 times since June to try and sort this out. At present they still have my rear wheel and can't give me a date as to when this will be resolved. I missed out on the whole of this glorious summer because I've been unable to ride my bike. Two lessons learned from this experience; never buy a bike by mail order and never buy a bike from Tredz.
If you'll get more items in catalogue, it will be a VERY good shop to buy in.
Excellently designed, good prices and quite a large catalogue. It's always worth to browse their website while shopping for outdoor items.
Large shopping catalogue, prompt support and good prices. A website that the outdoor entusiasts have definitely to look at.
In case you're living in Europe and you're looking for OWC products, this is the place to shop. There are not many shopping websites that sell OWC products in Europe. The prices are quite good: of course the american OWC website is cheaper but in this case you've to consider the shipping and importing duties. The delivery timing is good. Recommended.
One.com webhosting offers good features for the average user. The price is competitive and the support is always available. They're constantly improving the service with new features and that's valuable.
why should I put my confidence for a company that keep my money in their bags for a long time as 6 months?
I loose money and time with this company, never get what I paid.
I tried many times to get my vps, never get a response from the owner. absolutely stay away
I have no suggestions, you're so perfect. but try to improve is an ambition to anyone. keep it up. a greeting and thank you very much
This was the first time I had used FloraQueen and I have absolutely no complaints! The ordering process was clear and straightforward and the flowers were beautiful and delivered on time! What more could you ask for? Finally a company that does what it says it will do!!!
We rent a car in Cagliari airport and everything was good. The car was relatively new (11500 km) and clean. We spent 10 minutes to get the car and 10 minutes for the hand over.
An immensely huge variety of items of upper quality and an envyable range of all kind of wear. A very enjoyable trip through on line shopping , supported by a flawless top service : very practical, very immediate and careful ,and above all, very ' British '. Don't go any further ! This must be ' your ' shop.
I needed to upgrade the RAM of my ACER netbook, I found the module I needed from Offtek who sent me the item in no time and I had it over here, in Italy, 24 hours after I placed the order. Very quick service, excellent item. Now my netbook lives a second life. Thanks so much, Offtek!
I'd been meaning to buy from BCS for quite a while, but wasn't sure everything would go smoothly. It seemed like a lot of hassle just for a few goodies reminding me of home. But now, I'm delighted and will continue to order stuff online from this shop. Next stop the sausage and bacon counter, with some sliced bread thrown in!
the best site for travellers ,in tropical area,  that prefere to have the best !
I booked an apartment in Istanbul with my family, when we arrived the apart was different than shown on pictures: very low ceiling, very small windows, it was a kind of garret. The heating was off and when we turned it on it was working very badly, so it was cold, no blankets on one bed, they brought them 2 days later. The owner didn't answer the phone for 2 days. I contacted Wimdu 2 hours after my arrival but it answered only 2 days after, offering me another flat but charging me the 2 nights I spent in the cold, shady and different apart than the one I booked. It's a fraud.
If you want reliability and a shop that cares about you, it's  AstroNutrition.
Their books are awesome, great quality and low price. The shop service is efficient, the shipping time quite long in Europe, you need to buy a manual 3 weeks before starting a reparation job on your vehicle...
Very fast unlock Iphone 4 Movistar Spain , one day unlock and best support . Thank you again , I recommend to everyone trust
It's very easy to book a car. The price and service quality are very good. I'd reccomend to anybody to use this car rental provider.
If you are not demanded payment of 10% every time you make a reservation, it would be a positive aspect in addition, taking into account the fact that, in my experience, sometimes I've come across reservations beds, which then were not really available but in spite of this the cost of the reserve is deducted immediately ...
I already bought many cd keys from this company, I always got cheap price and fawless service. I would absolutely raccomand them.
I have placed orders from other companies in the UK and they usually ship in 12-15 days. I received my package in 3 days..i couldn't believe it, but then there it was exactly what i ordered, the product was of very good quality and perfectly sealed. I will buy from this company again.
I found every product I could not find elsewhere in europe ( most of the products they have are only found in the United states which at the end of the day with shipping and duty house taxes is extremely costly, not to mention the biblical times needed for my country's duty house to deliver it to me once i have filled and sent all forms they sent me for the products not to be withhold.) this gave me the possibility of buying different brands and products without making multiple orders, when i was looking for a supplement  i could not find personnel took personal interest in looking for the products which could contain it, with success. Also Products are a little cheaper than in my country Italy, i just wish delivery could be faster from there to here. I love LuxeBC it is amazing how vast their brand lists are i buy everything for my health here and always find what i need. I am extremely glad to have found this company online.
Ideapad Lenovo S205 corresponds to what you imagine for "chep radio-shack buy". Something that feels fantastic at a first glance, with good build and everything, for a convenient price. but when you use it everyday you realize why it was so convenient: while the front is designed and assembled with tigh precision and good plastic, the heart of the laptop is so crappy that it literally blows off all by himself. After 1 month using it I was discretely satisfied, until the battery melted the connecting pins and everything was ready to meet the rubbish can. And the worst part was the support: 1 week for letting me now that wasn't covered by the warrantee, another one to have an estimate of the expense of repair, 285 euros+VAT. Not bad for a netbook that costed me 280 euros VAT included. Thanks a Lot Lenovo!
No errors, fast delivery.  I just wish a few more items could be put on the website.  More ethnic items would be nice.
Altough I was not able to find a cheaper service, I do believe that to pay almost 20% more than the normal price just for the service you offer is too much. However you offered an outstanding service!! Strale13
Brilliant! My parcel arrived on time and in perfect condition! I would recommend BritishCornerShop to anyone.
I enjoy being able to order the few small things that I miss and that are difficult, if not impossible, to find in Italy. Delivery is good - my first order, just before Christmas, arrived in 3 days...this second one took a little longer, 6 days, but I'm certain that was down to the courier service this end and not the fault of BCS. Goods are packed well, plenty of bubble wrap! My only crticism if I have to make one is that the items are a little on the expensive side however delivery charges are more than reasonable. All in all a good service which I will no doubt use again in the future.
The code is sent in few minutes and work fine.
I bought my first ever MTB shoes and not only the online chat on website was helpful and quick by answering to my every doubts but the order was followed extremely quick.. I chose the more expensive shpment method cause I wanted a tracking number but nonetheless the order arrived 2 days after (I live in Italy) and the customer assistance was perfect. I would suggest wiggle to all my friends and I will keep on buying from them without any doubt.
It could be a fantastic present for your friend or just for you. The website it's simple, clear and complete!
I ordered for 329 euro in September 2012. Delivery rescheduled many times, then they offered to reimburse but the money never came. They call you back from some place untraceable and promise swift action but they are simply stealing your money. Do not buy from INFURN. There are many people affected and many are organizing lawsuits in different countries. I reported them to the Italian police but the site is still on and I am afraid many innocent people might fall prey of this scam Beware of the thief! INFURN gets your money upfront and NEVER delivers NOR reimburses - check the web
Very quick delivery even in italy, very good price and compatibility with my hp printer. I save a lot of money with this cartridge.......for now i just try the black one without any problem....i hope the same for the other ink.
the idea of this service is great, but don't always trust the 5 stars coz the may be made by staff of the site they r reviewing. it would be useful to have a tool that allow us to search for the negative reviews, or that allow us to sort reviews by stars.. we can have a real opinion about a site/e-shop by reading the 3 stars or lower
It has been an happy experience because delivery was in short time, price cheaper than others and good following of customer. Thanks
During the last months I ordered three different items to Futureshop and in all the cases the service and the timing of the delivery were very good. Once I ordered a cable not available for the delivery to Italy and Futureshop promptly reported to me the case and they proposed to me different alternatives: from the reimboursement to the offer of other products. Fully reccomended!
Great service and fast delivery but price has increased significantly since my last order. I tried to look for alternative products but there were so many options and the numbers didn't quite match my prescription so I stuck with what I knew. It would be useful to type in my prescription and see suitable products.
I thank Campingplus24 very very much for his perfect service: all has gone well, good product and expedition! Danilo
I had worked for Verizon business and it really was a good experience, colleagues and management are great! Products and services are superb! maybe they should simplify the internal procedures and to provide a better customer support.
cheap and bad service! the personnel is not very helpful neither
I log on youtube almost every day and is great for watching my favourite music videos! Maybe sometimes the sound track is not the excellent but I still believe that is a cool web site
The item is perfect and the shipment was very fast! I recommend to buy on this site!
satisfied with the goods but received  email and text messages stating that delivery would take place on 17th march and stayed in especially nobody came and  next day I received aagain email and text messages that delivery would take place on 18th as though nothing had happened
i purchased one gem from Multicolour online. i received it very quickly by fedex. when i realized the stone was not what i needed i contacted them to have it exchanged. it was not an issue at all...so i returned it and got other stones plus few more that i purchased. so i would say they are very professional and they offer good quality gems at right price.
I was very impressed with the service I received from Transferwise.  It was easy and very good value. I received the interbank rate. better even than any of the major FX brokers. I will definitely use them again
A charming resort, Borgo Grondaie is in an old Tuscan Farm close to Siena city center. Land surrounds the property making relaxing your stay. Nice salt water swimming pool. Thanks for making my holiday so nice!
I purchased from this site a gopro hero 3 + black edition. The price is absolutely the best on the market, the product flawless, fast and free shipping with DHL (6 days), friendly. My only doubt is their guarantee, there are no opinions on the matter about it. I hope that  they will be great also from this point of view.
Hello, I think an excellent supplier Paddock, precise and attentive to the needs of our Land Rover enthusiasts. Greetings. George.
Very positive experience, the shipment was delivered as scheduled all goods were perfect without any damage. I am happy to be able to have some English food also here in Italy. I have recommended this site to family and friends and will surely become a frequent customer.
This service is a very good one! If you need any information on it company that operate on line, it is very important to check affordance and reviews on it. Trustpilot provide it!
fast shipping to Italy. very serious online trader. next days test epistane  4 first time hope is good for me!
I've waited 1 day to receive the key but the game I was waiting for wasn't out yet so... I'm very satisfied!
I have yet to try the product, but I can say that powermyself give impeccable service
orders easy to enter and quick delivery of the items.
It is the second time that I purchase a painting from 1st Art Gallery and, again, I am totally satisfied. The painting ("Vase with twelve sunflowers II" by Vincent Van Gogh) arrived in a perfect state and the shipping to Italy was very fast, although it took place about 15 days later than expected. Nevertheless, it was really worth waiting that time as the painting is of a very high quality and the colours are great. William Casciotta Italy
good site for reservation hope everithing will be ok at the time of renting the car
Products with excellent value for money Quick shipment. Excellent customer care. I received a product that is broken during shipping, I have returned immediately without problems.
Sorry, there is no way I can let this slide. Your customer support, simply put, just plain sucks... at least in the Italian department. In the past two weeks I have experienced a very bad transaction on the internet by purchasing a pc video card from a local business putting up for sale their goods on the Pixmania web portal. I have promptly paid the item via paypal but my order didn't change status for more than a week; I tried then mailing the shop in order to know what was going on (i.e. why my order hadn't been shipped yet as it was already way past the estimate delivery time) but I didn't receive any answer. Puzzled by the whole situation, I left a first, negative review about the whole issue on the local business page here on Trustpilot. My review was shortly taken down because allegedly I had to send proof of the genuinity of the deal. I have promptly satisfied the request but after that I started then having an intense exchange of mails with a member of your staff, constantly censoring again my review claiming that since the payment was made on the Pixmania website then Pixmania should have been held responsible and that the review should be only on their page. Well, I'm sorry to say this is just RUBBISH. Who put in the first place the item for sale (even with a 5% discount coupon) on Pixmania? The local Italian company. Who was effectively in charge of the sale? The local Italian company. So why on earth was the item still there if it was not available? And who's to blame for canceling the order? The local italian company as they didn't really have the item in stock and waited more than a week before telling me... Pixmania wasn't at fault here; yet, I have seen my review denied on a technicality. Instead of applying common sense as it should be in a situation like this (other reviewers shared similar experiences, claiming almost non-existent communication with the seller/order canceling due to non-availability/very slow shipments, making this clearly a reiterate behaviour and something everyone should be informed of ASAP)  your staff thought it was best not to tarnish the local company's page but to write everything on Pixmania's page, going about it in a roundabout way and indirectly shifting the blame on the bigger fish. This is simply not acceptable... if your aim is to collect feedback in order to make your pages a good reference when purchasing items on the internet then it should be of utmost importance warning customers of a dodgy behaviour, prioritising the customers' safety. The way this case has been handled was extremely poor as the negative impact of the whole incident has been greatly reduced and the culprit's image has been distorted.
I stumbled in this website when i was planning a self-arranged trip to one of central asia republics. I had a low budget and wanted to avoid usual western tour operators to visit the country. The website offers contact of verified people who arrange trips in a specific country (they can be common people if the country do not require specific authorization to act as a guide) both a few hours long and two or more days lasting. The price is low because most money go directly to the guides, so you can take advantage of the fact that in certain countries your currency is high valued. I booked three distinct trips with three distinct guides and it proved to be a winning choice: great value for money, very nice local guides, easy going and friendly, a real contact with local society and genuine visits. The three guides spoke a very good english and since it was just me and them, we were able to develop a good relationship during the day, at the point that i am still in contact with one of them. The website grants that guides are able to perform the trips they sell and offers a page with customers reviews. Guides can be contacted directly through a contact form even before booking, so to gather further information before deciding wether to book the trip or not. Highly recommended for those who are looking for a true but still safe local experience and those with a low budget.
This website is a must for those who are looking for solutions, advices, suggestions and much more about all topics related to informatics. I am not an expert but in many situations i have found solutions to my issues just looking for the proper thread in the forum. Above all I appreciate the fact that moderators are always present to keep discussions on track and avoid them to become a mess of random comments. I would give five star if the indexing system for fast key-word search was improved, as sometimes is a bit frustrating to scroll tenths of pages to find the comment you are looking for.
888.it has some great games, and they offer a chance to win real money. The bast part is that the site is approve by AAMS so it complies with Italy's regulations. Enjoy!
Every inquiry about avilable roomscan hai bene answered quickly and sometimes also giving explanations and  availability for other periods.Payment easy and safe.good assistance throughout the booking.I world recommend  Homestay to every one!
Every product I ordered has arrived on time and I've found each one of them very good quality. Thanks.
Quick shipment great products highly recommend it, definitely go back to make other purchases.
My package to Denmark was recieved only after a few days.
Very interesting service, but it requires an accurate planning of attractions to visit. Some of them (e.g. walking tours) have to be booked well in advance. Anyway it is very easy to save with just few attractions.
the delivery was very fast, the package was delayed I do not know why, but overall good
It's on of the most important and effective stores on line specialyzed in Tools. Rich in the catalogue, is able to satisfy everybody, either professional, enthusiast or DIY users. Higlly recommended
You will never find a site who offer this price and who delivery your purchase for really and in a good time!!! MMOGA is the best ;)
I used Wimdu to find a place to stay with my family in Copenhagen, using their services I could find a place better and cheaper than any hotel in Copenhagen.
Fast shipment and good custom service. I've spoken with the owner who was very kind and friendly.  I recommend it.
very good car and service excellent price for a opel astra almost new
This is not the first game i got from them and i can assure you it will not be the last. First time i got a game from them they asked for an ID copy which i thought it was strange. After providing them the ID copy (only name and photo) in an hour or so the delivery was complete and i was able to activate my game (Wargame European Escalation) on Steam. Since then i have got like 4 other games with no problems at all. Even though they are not like GamersGate which provides you with the key instant, you can find tons of games at low prices, and the Customer Support works very well and fast (i used once when i got my copy of deus ex hr augmented edition and could not locate the extra content). All and all very good delivery and good games at good prices. I will recommend them to all my friends.
I have enjoyed my time when i browse its website as it offer a lot of variety and reasonable price for its product comparable with other online site. I have good experience with this company.
I've bought different module from this company, all for OSCommerce, none of the is working correctly, and i've been asked for more money to fix them. After 6 month i'm still waiting for them to fix the thing up, but now i'm sure i'll just sue them and make a professional do the job in their stead. P.S. They NEVER offered to fix it, so they are liar on top of being incompetent
I've boght this products some week ago and i have to say it is impressive, modular and the support is excellent!
I have seen that's more convenient to purchase from VioVet than from others shops here in Italy. Good prices and fast deliveries !
The website have a very attractive modern design. But there is no chance to see the content before paying a yearly  fee of USD 20. Among some nice  opportunity the website is full of crap posting from B&B etc.... I would have designed the businness in a different way...more like AirB&B where you pay a small commission only in case you apply for a housesitting...
I stayed in London only 2 days, so this tour showed me every part of the city!
I found the car I booked, at the price I booked it for. No bad surprises. Will use it again.
My friend loved the floral gift for her wedding. It will be better if will be available deliveries on saturday and / or sunday
Thank you for your attention to products that complement the diet so impoertante and your prices and deals that I find attractive and affordable. Continue on this road. compliments
I believe that is very important to interact with professional people when i'm going to buy something in a e-commerce site, that's why i give 5 stars to hifiheadphones.co.uk (of course everything else is ok!)
I purchased twice from MyMemory. They have a wide range of memory cards and devices and I always experienced a very fast delivery (to Italy) at very cheap rates. Will buy again and recommend to friends and colleagues. Thanks!
I bought FotoQuantum LightPro Flash Kit FQC-400LR/400LR + Tripods + Radio Trigger, 2 silver and 2 gold umbrellas and Backgrounds Cloth. Clear prices, fast shipping, and considering that arrived from Germany and minimal shipping cost (10 euros). The gold-colored umbrellas, however, had many faults.I explained them the the faults and within a week I have received two others more free of charge . Truly professional behavior and correct !
I've been using Hostelworld for over a year now, and I've always found very good hostels at great prices. The feedback from other people is extremely useful to choose the best place where to stay. Great site!!
The Citypass is the best way to see lots of interesting venues in New York and Hollywood and saving some money! And it also gives some discounts at gift shop!
fast shipping but damaged package and item in the wrong color and missing parts, very good seller but not good service
My primary concern was for a dairy-free (as opposed to lactose-free) probiotic for my daughter, who is casein-intollerant.  Not easy to find as most people and companies think the two are the same.  We are very pleased with our purchase, as she seems to tollerate the probiotics very well, and are hoping to see an improvement in her immunity this winter.  How do I know they're working? I don't need to remind her to take one every evening, she looks for it and takes it without my prompting.  Excellent.
I will recommend this kind of trip, the only way you can truly know a people, its culture, way of life and to report, just today when people are more and more alone, and you might find friends forever, who uses wimdu it is not an ordinary person, but of great openness to the world, you might think it is a great bussines, but not for real hosts, surely here are enrolled many people who think only how to make money, but who does not do a thing with passion, do not know how to welcome a stranger in your own home
I received ordered shoes in few days with an high quality package (never see before this accuracy on packaging shoes). Fully recommended this store.
Even living in Italy everything we have ordered has arrived quickly and at a reasonable cost
they had what I was looking for at a good price.
I bought different products from their website, usually Games. Best prices ever
thanks so much, now came the clock won, molt is nice, it's great, you were very fast in delivery, from England to Italy in just 3 days!!! is a beautiful valentine's gift for my husband!!! I recommend to all my friends
The shoes come in my home in only two days and everything is perfect.
I would always order from this firm as things arrive fast, well packed and the delivery expenses are really good.
Efficient , professional and friendly . Very kind people selling great products . I recommend it !
This is the best website I have ever come across. thousands of modern high tech gadgets, here you will find everything that are not yet on the market.. Incredible prices and high quality goods! I highly recommend ..
I used the smileprint.de design and ordering website. It was easy to use and the choice between various predesigned layouts was good. The website has some glitches where the layout of the business card was slightly scrambled after applying some changes. Overall the ordering of the business cards was good. Due to some problems with their IT I didn't receive any order confirmation nor any replies to my emails through their contact form. A call to their call center solved the hickups and was handled fast and friendly. The cards were received shortly after the support call by courier and are of excellent quality.
I ordered a Galaxy Note 8 and as ususal wanted to use my verified Paypal account for payment. The order was placed and canceled by Lambda-Tek rejecting payment from an unverified Paypal account. Very strange, at least the payment was refunded immediately. I was reluctant to place the order again, now paying with my credit card details directly. In the end this time everything worked out and delivery was fast.
I bought a Cressi travel BCD which was discounted due to a model change. It arrived fast and I had some great dives with it.
The best online shop today! Sometimes it doesn't have the best price, but it's still the best, especially if you want to buy books, ebooks, movies and games
The flight was ok. But if your luggage doesn't fit their box (which don't have standard size), you have to pay an extra that can be more than 50$/luggage!
It was a long time that i was looking for a betting site easy to use and reliable. I was recommended by a friend who uses it for sometime, and now I love it! It offers many options for to play casino, poker, games and offers a unique experience. The payment methods are very safe, and that is one of the reasons why i chose it, i prefere use paypal . The other sites I tried did not offer a complete service as well. 888 sport also has a simple and intuitive interface, so even for someone like me who is not very practical with the technology, it is very simple to use. I recommended 888sport to all the people who want to play safely, and want to spend a few hours of real fun.
Many clothes, fast shipping. Everything I bought was exactly as it was in the pictures
Is not cheap use this service, but staff of trustpilot work very well.
good evening I wanted only to compliment you with an service.fast,punctual in a word numbers one.regards
I bought from they a 2 joypad ps3 sony and other items. All perfectly works and the item are very good, high quality and the price is very very low. Good work FYYGAME.COM ;).
This store is awesome, the operator are very very very kind and the price and quality of kit are excellent. I bought from they 11 kit and I am very satisfed.
Highly recommended for anyone considering traditional Scottish dress or simply interested in a bit of Scottish history!
Rapid: my tags had been dispatched one day after i made the order. Good customer care: I wrote to them an email and i got the reply in abot 30 minutes. Good quality.
I really like Garmin products (I've owned 3 of them), but I do not like their website. I find it confusing and I never find what I need. It's easier to do a search on google and let it address you to the right page on their website. Sometimes they also release crappy firmwares that will be automatically installed on your gps if you use the web updater; your gps will just become useless and you will need to fix it by finding a solution on external websites/forums...
I've bought from Louis many times and the service was always great. They also have good prices and send stuff all over Europe with reasonable expedition fees.
I have ordered with them now and in the past and the company always proved to be fast, accurate, quality is very good, even more if you compare to the prices which are always the best in the market!
Absolutely the best casino on the web: a lot of games, Amazing graphics,  deposits are easy and quick. The software is very fast and the site is so simple to use. I love it!!
I subscribed a couple of months ago for a mobile package, and apart for a minor issue (I received a card with a new number waiting for my old number to migrate, 10 days after my number was moved to the oister card and I had to repay for the monthly subscription - it has to be said it was written on the site and I knew it so it is ok even if a bit annoying), apart for this minor issue - as I was saying -  I can't complain - Edit - Actually I didn't have to re-pay the monthly subscription, they just switched from the old number to the new so in the end I had even some free days :) that's why i change my rating from 4 to 5 :)
Everything went fine shopping on surfdome.com Two remarks: - description of surfboards are somewhat faulty (too much cut and paste) - lately prices in euros are lower on the main page with many products of a category, then are marked higher in the page of one specific product
I found here what i was looking for at the best price: go and enjoy Holland bike shop !
