inadequate packing two pairs of glasses without covers that shocked them and scratch the glass
I really like this site, a near addiction. Many flash sales, loads of choice and style of clothes, shoes, bags.... I've had a few issues which have been dealt very courteously.  I regret that that there is no telephone number though I can understand the reasons behind this so I won't be harsh on them for this, but I wish customer service could sign their responses as it seems that we sometimes deal with different people and it feels nicer to have a name.  Despite the issues, I am still a happy customer.  The sales coming from China, Light In The Box cannot be held responsible for expediting problems and country taxes as many seem to confuse where liabilities lie.  A big fan of LightInTheBox.
Firstly, You have to be very patient when you order, it takes 7 to 10 days so don't be in a hurry :-). Secondly, make small orders max. 15€/$ otherwise you'll pay extra fees/costs. Thirdly, enjoy your products. I ordered many iPhone screen protectors and I am very glad to pay those things 0,90€ instead of 15€ in Apple store !
I wanted to order a GHD (hair styler) for £105 instead of 125. What a good deal I thought. So I ordered the 9th of May, my parcel was expected to arrive the 15th but still no news... I waited 2 days more and just my luck it has been lost and moreover, the product was out of stock. I told the customer service that I was extremely disappointed and I would not accept any vouchers or discount because I just wanted my money back. They did so, now I am waiting for my £105 and they also gave me a 10% code on my next purchase. To be honest, I won't be ordering again and 10% is not enough...
The products are good, as the prices but it takes time to be delivered! I faced some troubles with a French VISA card, the shipping address... and for the second command some  products are not in Stock...
I have tried many types of earplugs over the years and have liked some more than others. The pharmacy was out of the ones I was using at the time, so I started looking online for something similar and ended up reading about these. I decided to give it a shot and it was the best decision! They are - by far - the best earplugs I've ever had!
They really are the best and so kind! I highly recommend them for any wine needs!
Happy to make business with PTUK, prices are attractive for a continental customer. Only the shipping price is really too expensive. Otherwise, there is no communication during the shipping, no worry, and suddenly, 3 days after, the delivery lorry brings you what you purchased. I noted the good package which was not the case with another tool shop in the UK. Regards. JS
ce site est excellent la livraison est ultra rapide et les prix son très compétitifs. ca resteras mon site de référence pour les cartouches d'encre
On order of four items , one of them delivered twice, but one missing .....
Very good website, lot of offers and very cheap. I was surprised when I found MMOGA, I checked if it was a serious shop, and it definitely is ! I receive the codes in less than 5 minutes. Not hesitate :) You can buy without any problem !
tout est parfait : les articles, la livraison et la communication
appel pour me dire la date d' envoi délais respecté super content
Don't spend your time browsing the web searching for games at low prices on untrustable websites. On GMG you earn money when your friends use your referal link to buy games, you earn gmg money, vouchers and rewards when ordering your game. I bought several games on GMG and never had any problems. Now it's the first marketplace I check when I want a game.
I ordered a mobile phone on this site on august 28th,2013. The status of this order changed a lot of times and the delivery date was differed a lot of times. Finally I cancelled this order on october 17th. Now, I am waiting for the refund of my money. I always received quickly very polite answers to my mails but made by robots ??? I hope I wil get my money back one day but I am not very confident. Avoid absolutely to put an order on this shop : Lost of time and lost of money. Refund recceived 3 days after the answer below.
Ordered a bunch of flowers for my daughter for her 21st which falls on a sunday , so i ordered for  them delivered to her office on the preceeding friday. All well up to that point, then my daughter tells me she's going to take the friday afternoon off. I get back    to eflorist to ask if delivery can occur the friday morning only and not the afernoon. I receive an e-mail confirming that eflorist have made contact with the florist to confirm delivery for friday morning, i.e. not some cheapskate robotised web site where anything out of the ordinary just doesn't get handled. Well done oh and yes my daughter's thrilled with the flowers. Thank   you
No issues with the delivery schedule - I was kept up-to-date and the delivery was bang on time. However, I was under the impression that the goods had to be checked by me BEFORE  the driver(s) left. Not so, according to the driver. He told me that I had 24 hours to check and then report any damage but he wasn't going to wait while I opened the goods to check?? Pleasant enough, but this is what I received from Oakfurnitureland in my booking confirmation: "This is a recorded delivery and you will be asked to sign to acknowledge both receipt of the goods and confirm that there has been no damage to your property. Should you be unable to sign please call us on 0844 977 3300 immediately while the drivers are still with you." I signed for receipt of the goods but of course, wasn't able to confirm the state of the goods as they remained unchecked in the packaging. So, who's right then the driver or Oakfurnitureland?
Journey to Dover was usual pleasant and efficient affair. However the return journey was less so. I paid extra for the 1st class lounge going out and back. On the return leg form Dover to Dunkirk I decided to sit in the section of the 1st class lounge with easy chairs and footrests where I would be able to get out my laptop and tap away. Unfortunately throughout the journey workmen were doing VERY NOISY repair work with continual hammering. It was impossible to stay in that section so I moved into the area with TVs and the self-service drinks and biscuits etc. I was very disappointed with my experience. When I asked the young 'waitress' about the noise she said the workmen had to do it then.... It was unavoidable apparently. It really spoilt the journey for me and I would not have paid for the upgrade if I had known. I went and checked the noise level in the regular lounge area, I.e. not the first class lounge and it was hardly perceptible. What's more no one bothered to explain - I had to ask why. I would like a refund for the return 1st class lounge charge, because clearly it wasn't first class.
I was frequently receiving special offer emails from Selections... I have tried to order several times. I get through the whole process, get a 'p&p' charge for delivery to my home - in FRANCE - I get an email confirming my order, etc, etc THEN I get an email saying "oh, we can't deliver to France, sorry, your order has been cancelled"... SO, why have postage charges to France if you don't deliver there???  Just 2 days ago I asked to be removed from the mailing list... then get today's email asking me to Rate their Service!!!!!!  RUBBISH, that's what I think!!!
After having a product that failed (issue with the KodakPlaySport), I contacted the customer for RMA. Sent the item on 6 september and asked for a refund. Since then, I'm sending emails twice a week to the customer service, i'm receiving apologizes ... they agree that the situation is unacceptable... BUT I STILL DON'T HAVE the refund yet. The customer service is not able to handle or escalate such topics. I'm really really upset by the situation and would not recommend anyone from buying to this website, because they are not able to solve problems.
avec Probikeshop les comment arrive en temp et a l'heure .
Whats good with easyjet: - When you book your seats in time, the prices are amazing - The only way to go when you're a frequent flyer non sponspored by your company Whats not so good with easyjet: - NO service. I hope you understand when i mean NO. If you're travelling with your whole family on a new destination, you may need some more service than easyjet will be able to provide. - Cheap prices, cheap "a coté". Dont expect anything more than a seat. If your luggage exceeds its weight limit, or if you want to eat in the plane just forget easyjet and lowcost companies cause they are even more expensive than classic ones ! Conclusion: If you know where you're going and the airpots you'll be visiting, and are alone or both of you, easyjet is a good way to go. You may check competition, but should consider easyjet. In any other situations ... You may check competition longer !
beau voyage sans probleme,bon organisation et super chauffeur MR RAJ
un tres bon site livraison ok pile a la date annoncée
super ! délais de livraison court et un mail m'indiquant la livraison chez mon monteur de pneu préféré.
Simple to find the route, simple to compare all the available prices and times and simple to complete the booking.....does what it says on the tin!!
Hi guys! Everything is in the title, worst experience ever since I buy keys on this kind of website. I got maybe 20 keys or more like this, and first time I got an invalid one (things happen). My complain is toward the support which is slow as hell and really rude, not even a 'hello'. I'm not even sure if I will ever get my key. To conclude : avoid this seller. EDIT: After one week of support message, I finally got a new key, which is also INVALID... I'm pissed of now and asked for full refund.
It's real good website. Since several years, I find all my perfumes. But be careful, it's the first time I had to pay custom charges when I received my parcel....in France Damage but I will buy again on cheapsmells.com ;-)
I made ​​several purchases on the site, and have had the opportunity to exchange messages, contact with the team was always pleasant, the site offers many choices of quality items, and for me for, delivery to France is quite fast, in short, I am very happy and recommend this site.
Only problem is that it slows down the internet connection.
Ibought a GS Xut, that works perfectly I just lost few screws that I can find with ease on Nitrotek site, only thing i don't appreciate is high cost of delivery for France(because things like screws could be posted by international air mail for packages not exceeding 100g) reference: 400044342
I was so fed up with the long drawn out process with my bank to change money and I saw on Money Expert this article on HIFX and how it was more secure than most of the Companies changing currency, so I made an account and checked out their site and Policy. I took the plunge and changed a small amount, even the money from my Bank was into HIFX account in under two hours, my rate that I had secured was never changed, the money arrived in my French bank account the day after!! Amazing are my only words! I then changed £23K the next day, same thing, no hassle just exactly as they promised and the rate of exchange never altered! As the publicity says "Just Do It!"
I booked a few days in this apartment last week and was not disappointed. Everything exactly as in ad. The kitchen is fully equipped and is even stocked with staples such as coffee, oil, and pasta. Good location, a short walk from the metro (5 min from Belleville). The lady who let me in was very friendly and courteous. I speak French so can't comment on her English. The only downside is that if you are tall (I'm 6'4") you will have to sleep diagonally in the bed as it has a frame at the foot of the bed, but you can see this in the photo. I don't think it can be beaten on price. You basically get your own nice Parisian apartment for the price of an average hotel room. Definitely recommend.
site pratique et complet, service a la hauteur des plus exigeants!!!
Site pratique , utilisation facile , cde facile et livraison rapide.
Nothing can justify the shipping cost I paid for my order.
tout s' est bien passé , la marchandise est belle et arrive à temps.
... et quelques sachets de chamalows pour caller mon colis ! Que demander de plus !
Very good service from this company. I had a query about my order which they resolved very quickly to my satisfaction. They even refunded my VAT as it was an export order. Recommended.
Ive been using them for a couple of years. In that time Ive had a few problems (faulty DVDs and DVDs lost in post) but they always sort these out quite fast. First class customer service and a good way to catch up with movies that you missed on general release but dont want to buy...
Sky themselves are overpriced in my opinion, but what choice do we have if we want premium channels these days? The website seems overbloated and while I used to use their tv listings service regularly the recent changes to the site make it harder to use and less useful.
Ive used Maplin since long before the Internet was around and they have always offered good value and service. They automatically deduct VAT for export orders and their customer service is very good.
I've always found that Amazon offer good pricing and delivery when they are shipping from stock, but I've not had very good experiences when buying from some of their merchants, who refuse to ship to Channel Islands or will not deduct VAT (Amazon do this automatically on goods they supply).
I ordered from this company a few years ago and was impressed.. The website name changed, but the service is good and no fakes or dodgy imports.

I LOVE my new red and round framed bi-focals.  I look younger apparently, which is a good thing for an old person such as myself. But also there is more long distance lens to see my violin music easier when the stand is rather far away and the specs are very comfortable on the nose as they don't dig in.  Not only that but they only cost me 44euros in total which I think is amazingly lowpriced. Thankyou very much Select Specs.
I've been hanging on to my pounds for years - I lent my euros to my son to help him buy his house in Greenwich.  I didn't repatriate them and the pound crashed.  I've been waiting ever since for a renaissance - which came (partially, at any rate) recently.  So I reactivated my HiFX account and have made 2 transfers - the pound is good (or rather, the euro is bad), so July was the time to move some GBPs into eurs. With HiFX, once your account is set up, it's a 'piece of cake' to transfer large (or small) sums.  I've not compared other agents, but HiFX - that I learned about via the 'Connexion' newspaper - gives excellent and prompt service - and I assume the rates are good too....
livraison rapide article correspondent a la description tout et dit !
I send flowers to thank some new friends for their invitation at dinner. I think they appreciated the flowers because they called us to say the were very pleased! I was so happy with your exceptional rapidity to deliver the flowers. Very professional, very helpful!!! Thank you very much! Olga
I wanted some goods taken from Devon to south west France, with reasonably flexible dates. I posted the details and received about a dozen quotes. I didn't choose the cheapest quote, but the person who impressed me most with the information they gave and the positive reviews they'd received from other customers. The whole process was so easy  -  thank you Any van
Everything as stated on the site! Clear sales and return conditions would be a great improvement. Cheers
From the moment you choose your order to the moment you are wearing it every step is simple, easy, and fast. It is also much cheaper than anywhere else. I've ordered my Rochas Man on Monday and could wear it on Thursday the same week. Thanks a million
I didn't know Tripsta but Opodo and the rest of it as anyone. They are incredibly responsive and follow your reservation as if you were their only client. I used the hotline once and got a friendly and effective real person on the line.This is the kind of customer service you really need. I am a French customer, booked a flight to Mexico which has been modified three times by the airline company. Each time I was advised and sent a new ticket. They are now my company of choice for flight booking Garrett
I am very happy with my order on this website, as they offer good and cheap products as well as convenient and fast delivery. I would recommend to anyone...
j adore cette boutique j suis fan c vraiment pas cher tout est super
very well Superstore also perfect for communication and transport in a word to recommend without moderation
I ordered a design lamp which arrived in time & corresponded exactly to my order. Uaredesign had inquiered beforehand by mail to know which was the exact version i wanted as some details of the lamp description were missing on the site (much appreciated!!).
3 titleist cap ordered a saturday envening - sent the next monday and received thursday in France. Good prices compare the other providers but delivery costs to France a little too expensive  for small goods. Something disappointing : I tried to complete my order with another goods (to optimise the delivery costs) - so I wrote to the sales email adress but no answer... It's not the first time that I wrote to this adress without any answer...
A good website to have good prices but every products are not available even if they are not indicated out of stock (bad experience in 2012 but no more in 2013). So If you are ready to wait a little no problem but if not go elsewhere... A first experience in 2012 with 5 * but two later orders in 2012 with more difficulties, two recent orders in 2013 with fast delivery despite club with fitting so an average with 4 *. A great improvement since 2012. Thanks
Very good prices - use the weekend discount offers ! fast delivery. Two orders in 2 weeks and for the two orders, a good satisfaction Highly recommended.
I order a lot throught the web from many country from US, ASIA and UK and I was more than satisfied with this compagny for the following reasons: -THE PRICE: Cheaper than everywhere else + free delivery...to France. -THE FAST SHIPPING: Item (a camera) was sent straight after the ordered was placed and I was able to follow the parcel on internet. It took one day for the parcel to leave the compagny (30th of dec) and to arrive in France (31st of dec). and the parcel was delivered on the 5th of january due to new years day and week-end. Otherwise it would  have been at home 2 or 3 days max aftyer ordering. -GOING THE EXTRA MILE: indeed, I ordered the item in a UK and was delivered in France and it was a (good) surprise to find in my parcel a travel adapter plug and a french wire and plug. this was extra (separated fron the camera baox) and not mentioned when I ordered the camera. A gesture that prove IMHO the serious and care of simplyelectronics. I recommend.
I traveled a few times from Copenhaguen to Paris with Norwegian. I am a French guy living in Aarhus so the good thing about Norwegian flights to Paris is that it will (sometimes) be cheaper than SAS for example. The other good thing about it its that in Paris you arrive at Orly wich is the second airport of Paris. This one is less busy and actually closer to the city! The bad things about Norwegian is the "hidden costs" when you get your tickets online. For example if you want to get luggage with you, its an extra cost and they don't tell you that upfront. What's more, the staff at the airport was not very useful nor friendly when I needed check in information. On-board staff was OK though! Overall, for short trips Norwegian is OK, however be carefull of how many bags you'll carry!
We love lucky charms , give thanks to my american market to sell it to france !!
I bought from overseas (france). The information and follow up via email from mark was excellent before the purchase. Once money transfer was confirmer, the shipment was made very quicky and received as per order. Very professionnal.
Such a very good idea and it's work very well. It's a website which make connection between travelers and local people, for sharing culture, discovering real local places, and just meet news people. That's just simple human relationship. I am a CS member since a couple of years, I used it in various countries and I always kept a good memories and I trust in people I met.
As Jalbum user since  4 years, I really appreciate it, because the result is very nice to see, compatible  with most of the computers, on the web. It's easy to generate an album. You can easy test and use your favorite skin. I use it on Windows and Linux and it work fine. Just take note that on Linux it is quite slower, due to all the java stuff I suppose, but independent from JAlbum.
Parfait ! Merci + + + + + + +
Among the great advantages are the wide array of activities possible, the easiness of use for booking, effectiveness of queue cutting, etc.... So, it's true that it is quite expensive, but given the number of benefits you get from this card, it is worthwhile !
all was perfect...!And on top of that, it's cheaper than in France...!
The product was sent very quickly , one or two hours after my requisition. The post service sent the product in France the day after ... and ... The french postal service needs 5 days to deliver the product !!! a shame .
I've been ordering from their ebay shop for a while and now I order directly from their site. I've always found very good deals and the service is perfect! They ship very fast but unfortunately it took 7 to 8 days for delivery from Germany to France (postal services are longer than ever these days...). Anyway, Highly recommended!
A super way  to find a transport for small or big items at a competitive price. Thanks to Anyvan.com I could get in touch with reliable friendly people who took very good care of the furniture I needed  to bring over from UK to South of France and  on another occasion to send from France to Belgium. I was equally satisfied with the last job I posted on their site which was a total removal within London. Lots of quotes within minutes. I strongly recommend their services.

Shoes are very well, the headland would have to be more flexible and I did not find protect them heels which go on .
I wished offer a GHD straightener for christamast . i phone one month before , to organise the pruchase day and delivery to , be able to turn back if my girl friend get no satisatcion .

I order wednsday and a computer failure from GHD let me for christmast without present for my girl friend . no buisness action from ghd for this trouble.
I is not exactly received the product which I had commanded, and I is not had of news when I indicated them the error
Not sure whether there was insufficient postage on this order or whether it was because it was specified airmail on the package but it took two weeks to reach me (in France).  This was the only complaint I have,  as the ordering was fine and the goods ok.  The parcel appears to have been despatched quickly - perhaps I should blame the French post office, who knows?  Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.
I bought my Mountain Bike and accessories on this website, the prices were amazing and the delivery was really fast, They have a huge choice of bikes, parts and clothes for every prices. I strongly recommend this website for all your bike-related purchases
Trustpilot is a company that means what it says, and says what it means.
Ordering from France, it's very fast and easy to order on Country Attire. Large choice of products i fully recommend !
Commande facile , envoi rapide et soigné en point relai prix promo super content
This is a very easy way to make something attractive with your pictures. Even children can use smilebox ! So try it !
Website look is ok, but the goods out of stock should be taken off the site, delivery is really fast. They should mentionned what the limit is for payment by credit card or having a warning at the checking out. There really is a what you can call a service behind the website and it was (hard, fair) possible to find a solution to my payment issue.
Commande de 2 puzzles 1500 pieces et de 2 rouleaux pour ranger les puzzles.
The product was cheaper, available, delivered securly, and the communication was good. What else should I expect from a online shopping website ?
Camera & accessories ordered and delivered at exact price, no extra cost. I paid only what was specified on the website. Packet was made very seriously. I am very glad of this order.
ordered a gel case for htc one S good quality and a fair price delivery quite fast and well packaged very recommanded

It took me 1h to buy on this website -they refuse to give you the key (you paid for) because they need to check if you gonna use it - you need to download their programme for stream when you gonna use it (else they will not send it to you) - you need to wait before have acces to their support (between 5 and 10 min) for stream DO NOT BUY ON THIS WEB SITE
I know the site recently by my daughter, prices are cheap, and the models are all original. We ordered robes and leggings, and we have not been disappointed so far. Delivery is fast 7 days max.
Good prices and even better checkout experience now they have integrated amazon payment
the website made his job.. but not the transporter. Looks like the goods came 2 days only after my order. But i was working the delivery day and the transporter came to my home... and didn t let any protein or paper to let me know they came ! 10 days later when i started to be worried, i search and find that they let my protein at the Post office...
merci encore pour votre envoi , grand professionnalisme , on est toujours informer de la progression de la commande , bravo merci
My order has been perfectly honored in all points of view
The product was as I expected, and the delivery faster than expected.
As usual my glasses were dispatched quickly and they are perfect. I always buy my glasses here and have never been disappointed.
I signed up for the newsletter with a promise of a 5 euro discount with my first purchase. However the discount voucher never arrived. I then ordered some shoes as I was desperate and AFTER I had paid, the discount voucher arrived by email. I was thus unable to make use of it and I feel cheated.
Bought some clothes for my daughter for Christmas so I can't really comment yet on the fit. The quality seems good and above all the prices are excellent. I only gave 4 stars as postage was very slow.
I've booked a car with car-2rent and needless to say how easy it was and that the service was great. When I arrived to pick up the rental they upgraded me without extra cost. I recommand it :)
I ordered a Janome 3000 SMD equivalent of the Janome 8077 in France. Competitive price, our interlocutor Russel responds very quickly to our questions by email, free express shipping in France more full of gifts. My machine is a marvel, I love it! I highly recommend this site. Pascale from Paris
Everything is in the short version of this review. I'm very happy with my purchase. The price was great, the key was delivered perfectly on time (even a little bit before expected) and everything went smoothly. Perfect
What a pleasure to shop on this website, sooooo easy to view everything and down select products.  As for checking out - this was swift and secure. Thank you for making internet shopping such a pleasure!
Lakeland-Furniture is great except a bad shipment to France with Chronopost...
La commande est simple et la livraison rapide, le transport pour 2 chats est super et très beau!
Animed is an online pharmacy which certainly provides the cheapest prescription medications I can find on the internet.  However, they have failed on two occasions now to note that my prescription covers FOUR months' supply.  So the second time I try to order, I am told I have no valid prescription.  This is infuriating to say the least!  They would be definitely my first choice of an online pet pharmacy if they would just read the documentation a little more carefully.
I asked them some questions, they answered promptly and thoroughly. I have had no problem at all with them and their prices are among the best. I am glad to recommend them !
Impeccable ! Quoi dire de plus quand tout est parfait ?
But why does it take so long just to get your car keys even you have booked everything in advance? This is common with all car rentals Also, a little disappointed with the car as make/model has not been respected....and no upgrade for sure!
I have made 2 transfers of £2000 for France and on my recommendation 2 friends have sent money to France and Australia. Transferwise has worked perfectly every time. Cannot recommend enough.
This site is very easy to use. Just put in destination and departure locations along with dates and you get times and prices all on one screen instead of having to either remember or write down the information as you go along. It is also cheaper than going direct to the ferry companies.
As they were out of the 1.5 m QED cable I ordered, they offered me the same identical cable in  3m size at no extra cost. Shipping to France took less than a week.Prices are highly competitive as compared to the Continent as well. Excellent job !
a very good choice to be sure to see the very best of london, we had a complete vision of the town and all famous monuments, comment of the visit were very interesting. I appreciate booking on line, easy and quick, no problem when we arrive in the town.
I listed the job on AnyVan.  It was simple, although I might have been persuaded by the formats to itemise everything to move, which would have put me off.  However, as I was relocating from storage, I chose to give the 'big picture' along with volumes of storage occupied. The bids were swift and multitudinous!  After I rejected some bidders on price, they rebid lower.  Questions were posed in each direction and helped to clarify mutual expectations - mine and bidders. I carefully read the reviews and, on those bases, weeded out some contenders.  I did the same based on insurance levels. In the end, I narrowed down to a national player and two fairly local bidders. I was delighted with my choice of Iannn.  He and his partner, Jake, did a fantastic job.  They bent over backwards to help and I was delighted. Thank you, AnyVan
Excellent web site, very interesting prices, quick delivery, Payment system really trustable and efficient, shipping really performant too... Even if the best is really the custommer service, giving very good advices by phone, and very helpfull... even for somebody who speaks a very bad english !!! Thanks a lot, perfect on all the line
Really pleased with what I got from these guys. Execellent prices and delivery to Sweden in less than 3 days!
formidable , rapide , et prix raisonnables , seul probleme , dometec ne livre pas en corse ! il faut faire un effort !
I recommend this store to the people who have Rotax or Rok.
Very fast sending, wonderful quality products, friendly staff to ask questions to by e-mail... I recommend !
I booked a hotel in Spain through Amoma.  It was really easy and quick.  They also gave the best price.  I would use them again with no hesitation
They sent me the wrong size and ignored my email when I asked to return the product. We had a few emails before so it was clearly on purpose.
I would recommend this company to anyone, it's a great way to find the best hotels in most area of the world. They are also very available/helpful on the phone.

Two order in a week ; two times perfect !
Many choices of brands at competitive prices, customer service highly available and highly effective Delivery fast and economic
I purchased four gloves and two beanies. The website is secure so there are worries about your sensitive information. I chose the EMS shipping method, which was really fast (the items arrived in two days). The quality of the items was top notch while their price was very reasonable. I would definitely buy from YESSTYLE again.
i would recommend Bookatrack for every track booking. Well done to the team !!
It was my first purchase and not the last one for sure!

Sending an order on sunday and dispatched to the huose the last saturday. it's excellent !
I purchased a dress through the asos marketplace, when it arrived it was two full sizes smaller than I had purchased. I asked for a full refund to return or a partial refund for alterations. I had hell getting a refund and after finally getting things resolved with a partial refund, a customer service representative said I was a thief and I had to pay back the refund immediately or return the dress at my own expense and ship it to China. Terrible service, you should be ashamed!
O2 is surely giving a discount to all customers that have been affected about the network disruption for 24 hours in July but they offered me 1,34 pounds on my 58,99 pounds bill (screenshot can be provided and will be posted on my Facebook). I think it's not that much of an good offer especially when I'm thinking I've been stuck of my own flat trying to call my friend that was inside, with no network. I also think O2 may loose potential and existing customer by charging mobile data sizes on 3G with iphone 4 and above versions. Many mobile providers are offering it. I went for O2 because I was sure the quality would be there, whatever the costs. But I'm afraid it's not. Waiting for a proper return from customers services with a better offer.
You find all the jobs offers of the market on this website and the data provided are very useful (average salary for a position and evolution... Etc). It is easy to use.
I've ordered a pair of ATV360 tour golf shoes, the model i was looking for wasn't available in France. Few hours after my order, the packet was sent and 5 days later in my mailbox. Great place to make shopping.
i'm not leaving in UK so it took 1 week to be delivered, and I haven't been able to follow the delivery process, but the product is great and my son very happy, and that's the most important thing !!!
Initially, setting up my receiving account details in my TransferWise account, and the TransferWise bank details in my online banking account took a little time, but that first transfer was fee-free.  With all the donkey work done my last transaction took barely 24 hours from starting the transfer to receiving the funds in my French bank account, and all for a 0.5% fee, and at a very favourable exchange rate!
Perfect – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.
Unfortunately, the sliced bread had been packed in so tightly that they were all squashed. Otherwise, I have no complaints about communications and delivery.
The departure and destination were easy to find on drop down list. calendar is easy to handle. Very little waiting time during search. Great overview on price and time. Easy to book. Could just not book additional baggage - such as golfbag! Need to do at airport.
I'm a french customer and i have to say : delivery is veryyyy fast i never had one single problem with this website. I'll come back for sure !
I live in France permanently and have a beagle/griffon cross Pigalle (Pigs).  Not only do we have the usual fleas to contend with here in the South of France but we have mosquitoes and sand flies and an incredible abundance of ticks.  To combat all this, I know that a Scalibor collar is the answer, but they are quite expensive in France - €17 on the best website, to €32 in a pharmacy - so I found Animed on the Internet with the best price of £10.29, and also for Drontal Plus worming tablets.  To avoid exchange rate costs and delivery charges to France, I paid with my UK debit card and requested delivery to my sister's UK address, and she can bring them over on her next trip.  It couldn't be easier and I will continue to do this.
A friendly company specialising in pens and refills who are willing to post abroad.
Very good. No reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone
RAS ce service est parfait pour vendre ou mème acheter un article on y trouve de tout
I know this site for many years and I visited their shops in London. I never met any problem and the quality is good. About sizes, you can easily return the product in case it doesn't match your body. The PVC product line is one of the best I know and very competitive. For Latex too. This is a very reliable site and frankly, I can just recommend it!  Please continue as you are and add new products and keep older ones! And let us know.
Everything was perfect from A-Z! I had problems paying (new credit card) and got an e-mail from Rob asking me why I had not gone ahead with my order. The credit card pb solved, I ordered & received my LCD screen & screwdriver VERY quickly (I live in France). Packaging was perfect, the product was perfect & my (old) Nokia phone is now (almost) as good as new! Congrats!
I've bought some items in with express postage on monday and had UPS knocking on my door tuesday at noon! Great service!
The correct strings arrived on time at a good price from an easy website - Thanks!
ces tres simple de commander , et il respecte leur date de livraison , en un mot genial
A very good Seller fast ans serious at a good price. Georges from France
I live in France and were looking for specific speaker cables from Supra. I ordered on this site and got my cable well packaged only after 5 days via the standard Royal Mail shipping. Very quick delivery to France, price is fine and product in line with description. Highly recommended.
This is the best online shop dedicated to Bike World. I really mean "World"...
I bought from Gk4.com 4 TSW keys. When i bought them it was specified that i'll have to DL the client and redeem the keys using Origin. There the problems started, because none of the keys were accepted by Origin. So i start to mail them, no answer (still got none btw). And i try to redeem my Keys directly on Funcom and that was a good idea because there the two keys were accepted and the friends to whom i offerered the game won they're access. So i would say that this seller is not a thief but you have to have a mind if you buy from them 'cause they won't help you to solve your problem if there is one.
I bought 6 different pairs of shoes on Macbeth website (along with another one in a shop in SF), all were delivered within only few days from the Netherlands to France through UPS. I once received a faulty pair of sneakers, Brightons actually. I emailed the customer service which offered me to either receive a refund or a free new pair of shoe. It's rare to receive such a service, at least here in France. Just a couple of pictures to show where the shoe was damaged and without any further question, the fund had been transferred onto my bank account. Finally, having so much choice for vegan sneakers is awesome, it's kinda hard to find anything vegan in France without having to lose an arm and a leg, hence the happiness on my face when I discovered Macbeth shoes for the first time. Keep up the good work!
I bought two Steam key for a game and I mistakenly reject the second key, he sent me another one very quickly, the support is really good, I recommend this site for amazing price, time delivery of some minutes and a powerful support.
voilà un site extra , rapide , sans surprise et aux tarifs de premiers ordres .
I am very disappointed by this site. I paid for 4 articles and I received only 3 from it! I contacted the customer service and well on no answer. Find you that normal?
I read the other reviews before ordering, but I was still surprised by the professional, efficient service that the staff at Iconic Watches provided. I received regular emails on the status of my order and my queries were answered promptly. I recommend them without hesitation.
I was disappointed to learn that despite what was written on the website I didn't manage to get my product within the 5 advertised days
Dommage qu'il y ai beaucoup de produits en rupture de stock
I urgently needed a replacement phone fo my work.  I noted 3 working day delivery on the MobiCity website. Since an urgent delivery was essential, I chose to buy from MobiCity.  I ordered it on 8 March.  It was delivered 25 March! and I was obliged to change the delivery Country to get it by that date. On the occasions when I called MobiCity support to chase-up my order, I was continually led to believe that it would be delivered sooner than it would be in fact. This misleading information prevented me from cancelling the order and re-ordering from another supplier. When I asked why it promised three day delivery on the website,  I was told this was not delivery to the customer, but to some MobiCity depot....!! Message to MobiCity -  If you put 3 days delivery on your website, then you should check stock and reserve the item during the order process, and then you should meet your commitment, otherwise you are seriously misleading your customers, and getting orders by dishonest means.
I was a bit apprehensive about using the site at first and did not feel much better after first posting the job up because some of the quotes were very high, then after a day the quotes simply got lower and lower.  After accepting a quote all went really well with good communications between myself and the transporter and my goods arrived in perfect condition.  Happy customer :-)
En utilisant ce service on gagne de l argent et en plus on fait un geste pour l écologie !
thanks for your very quick service and fast answer if there is any problem !
The products Gamola offer are first class and the price is always very reasonable. Gamola is a trusted supplier always the authentic products and a great delivery service.
Qualité de la tasse et de la photo : parfait.
I am french the service is very very good thank you very much
livraison rapide, super matériel et pas cher. Que demander de mieux??
After my 1st payment online hadn’t been through for some reason, I received a call from Dagmar from hoteldirect and an email offering extra 10% off on my reservation. Dagmar was patient and followed the payment until confirmation of reservation. I am more than happy with hoteldirect high quality service.
Un excellent site pour aider les gens ... Une belle chaîne de solidarité ....
a busy best market price catalog very good package tracking
We live in France and were visiting family in the UK for one week.  We ordered over £1000 worth of teak garden furniture to be delivered on May 1st.  [Name] guaranteed that he could deliver on that date as we were catching the ferry home that evening.  I made a bank transfer on the Saturday before delivery and e-mailed 3 times after that but there were no replies.  Finally on the Wednesday I managed to get through on the telephone to be told that the chairs I had ordered  were out of stock.  [Name] then tried to make out that he hadn 't received my emails but my computer told me otherwise.  I asked for an immediate refund but needless to say I have not yet received it.  I shall be contacting trading standards next week.  No need to contact trading standards as after this review appeared my money was refunded in full.  I was also offered a discount if I changed this review and bought furniture on our next visit.  I declined the offer.
What an efficient service from GolfOnline, a pleasure to do business with them.
Very pleased with our ferry booking and the AFerry site which is easy to use and offers very competitive prices.  Always check the AFerry site first before we make a ferry booking.
The web site was easy tho operate and very clear. The cash came on the day it was ordered for. When I telephoned with a query the response was quick, friendly and helpful. My one regret is that there was no provision on the website to ask for large denomination notes.
I have had several deliveries in England and in France from Rue des Puzzles and everything has been in order and delivered quickly and efficiently.   Wonderful selection of puzzles but I would like to see more 500 piece puzzles, especially art and travel.
si seulement il n y avait pas un temps si long entre la commande et la livraison !
aucune information lors de rupture de stock apres passage de la commande
There was the option of 'express' delivery for an extra charge.  This took ten days, UK to UK.  When I wrote about it, the customer service rep was defensive and not solution-oriented.  The product is perfect - a good solid EZ bar - but I will never pay for 'express' delivery from Powerhouse again.
L étui de la paire de lunettes est trop petit , elle sort de l étui
not to bad ! it's just a little long for de delivrency  but the dresses are beauty and I love soooo much you dresses, it's so beautiful ! Good next and luck for the websit
It was very easy.  I phoned and explained the amount of sterling I would like to transfer.  I added that my British bank has a daily limit and that it would take several days to complete the transaction.  No probs!  I was advised of exactly the amount in Euros that I would receive and the day it would go into my French bank account.  The woman at Currency Solutions and I checked that the details I had for the CS bank account to be credited were correct, and I was given a reference number.  The day that my final credit arrived with CS it was transferred to my French bank account.  It really could not have been much more pleasant and simple.  The assistant also told me of the facility to prebook a rate; hoping that the £ may rise in value against another currency.  This was something I’d not noticed on the CS website having, I confess, not having looked at it for some time.
Thank you for your professionnalism . I was kept informed step by step of the progression of my order . The flowers were sent the day of the wedding . The bride and the groom sent me a nice photo of the bouquet . The flowers that were sent were even more beautiful than the ones I had previewed on internet .
This stuff is very useful and great ... none can lie anymore .. consumers get their power back ! !
The trip was good, we had a very pleasent cabin, tea making facilities we found a very useful addition to our experience in the past, a nice sleep, wake up to a shower and cup of tea. more than ready for the next leg of our journey.  Thank you
I called and asked for advice to this firm, and was given the exact information i required
I ordered once on this site. The command was conform to what I ordered and was shipped not too quickly and I had no information by mail or on the website that this command was shipped. It was because I was worrying and sent an email for information that I knew it had been shipped.
Delivery expected in the morning but done end of afternoon. Otherwise, everything was fine.
hello I would like to say thank you for the quick sending of my order, watch SKX007 with delivery in France. The watch is superb. It was well packed and warranty paper has been buffered thank you! Your prices are very competitive and your quick responses to my questions via email proving once again the seriousness of your site. I wish you a good continuation. thank you
Easy to use website, with clear and accurate description of products. Fit perfectly as the description said, and the deleivery was fast and straightforward.
The service is really quick, efficient and easy to use. They send you progress reports on the status of your FX transfer at regular intervals and respond to email questions within an hour, which seems exceptional. Just brilliant
I canceled my order the 30th april 2014 and we are the 20th May 2014 and I didn't receipt the refund. The customer service send me the same mails for 3 weeks ago. I called the customer every day but no more news. I heard that there are some people with the same case than me. Did I lost my money ?
One item has been changed because you were out stock. Sure I have been upgraded which is nice. If I was aware of this change before the delivery I would I have appreciated even more.
beau produit la carte est tres belle mais la qualité de la photo n est pas top
Bulkpowders allows bodybuilders to make substantial savings on their complements. No bad surprise, neither on quality product nor on delivery.
Perfect – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.
I had no problem to find the book I iwshed and then to make the order.
may be preparing for a little faster control Thanks You
I've used Paddock for spares since I bought my Discovery 10 years ago. I live in France but delivery is always quick, reliable and very very reasonably priced.  The website is well set out and easy to use - I always find what I need quickly and easily, and should I have any doubts there is always help at the end of the phone. I wouldn't even consider going anywhere else for Landrover spares now.
It is very easy to prepare the journey:you can change the details at any time and choose between companies and ports.
Clear information on product, good promotional offer and fast delivery. I recommend!
I ordered a Janome 6019QC when my very old Singer died, with a view to learn quilting and applique. I ordered on the internet and the machine was delivered the following day at lunchtime, as notified by text, so I wasn't waiting around all morning. The machine itself is amazing, so smooth and quiet and handles fabric precisely with beautiful stitch quality. I am making a small quilt out of patches of scraps of various textures and it joins all the squares right to the edge with no nasty tangles underneath. I am delighted and the machine is a joy to use. The extras supplied as part of the deal are amazing value, and are worth a huge amount. All in all I couldn't be happier!
I complained  about this with no interest shown on the part of FloraQueen
put an order through web; had unexpected problrem with credit card; TRANSAIR called me on the phone straightaway and we could fix it over the phone. Order arrived within 3 days. Excellent!
Great products (even though they look bigger on the website than really), and good shipping. Received the products in France less than a week after placing the order. Will buy again for sure.
Once I bought I received the key in 2 minutes. It works properly. No problem !
After a little technical problem everything went all right and my problem was taken in charge right away.
We're really happy with Highland Titles. My daughter received her title few days before her birthday.
On time at the pick-up point yet we were the last ones to enter the bus... we had to seat  on the side with a view on the bus stairs... not very nice even if I can understand the practical problem I consider that when you pay £67 for a visit/person, you could expect more. Regarding the visit of Harry Potter studio, it is nice but it is difficult to take pictures because of the crowd and you do not have access to all the settings (railings preventing people from going closer, which of course I can also understand as far as the protection of the settings are regarded but again, you expect more). Finally when other tourists just had to get in the bus, we had to wait 45 min before being allowed to do so (the bus was here, but the driver not!) ... the good thing this time is that being the first ones in the line, we got nice seats in the bus this time.
tout a ete parfait de l expedition a l article recu
It is so easy to make up the shopping basket over several days, or even weeks, and the information which comes from BCS is speedy and accurate. Unfortunately, my last order suffered badly at the hands of the delivery agent, and several items were badly damaged : never fear, I rang and spoke to Nina, who asked for all the details in an e-mail, and within TWENTY MINUTES she had investigated, and contacted me to let me know that all the damaged items would be re-dispatched immediately. I don't know what they give their staff to make them so helpful, but could they please bottle some and send it to HMRC, any of the major Banks, Dept of Work and Pensions etc etc...
I placed my order on a weekend, paid with Paypal, and my order was confirmed, shipped (to France) in no time. Great job guys and thank you.
c'est ma premiere commande et tout est arrive rapidement et est conforme a la description .
Hello, I'm a french ballroom dancer and had bought Supadance products since 5 years. I had never been disappointed of them. The website is clear, the delivery quick and exchange always possible. If a mistake or a problem occurs, it was solved.It's a real honest company. Our Dance Club had bought Supadance products too for each competition dancer. My son and my husband appreciate latin and standard shoes even if the price seem high for some people. Thank you for all and long life to their quality.
tout est parfait de l'envoi a la reception . rapide et sans accros merci
I ordered 4 DSW & 2 DAW at very good price, good delivery to France in 4 days, perfect !
Cleverboxes sent this clever box containing my new pc and it was up and running in half an hour. I love it. Am getting my head round the Windows 8 but the desktop is always there when I need it. Excellent advice and service to ease me through a minefield of choices.
I've got to admit that i was a bit frightened about ordering a digital code. As i'm french, i was afraid the website did as another one i visited: asking for a pic of credit and identity cards. But nop! On this website it all simply worked with a phone number approval which was a bit more fine for me. I was also afraid that the code would be already used (as i'm not the kind of person who's lucky), but it did work!! :D Everything went perfect for me (something rare) and i finally could OWN Chrono Cross on PSN which has never been available in my country. The only negative part is the fact that the card costs 11,99 instead of 9,99.
Can't believe I ordered flowers online and just over an hour later got a thank you email from the recipient! I've used Teleflorist a few times now and have never been less than delighted with their flowers and their super-fast delivery. Couldn't recommend them highly enough!
Don't hesitate to purchase from this company.  I found the flame-tipped bulbs I've been searching for at a reasonable price, and their international delivery charge is not much more than their UK delivery.  My items arrived very quickly too.
Thank you very fast delivery and control I live in France. Merci beaucoup je recommande ce site
imagine, you want to be up to date at the best price, that you want to smell in a rafined french way and feel happy when sending unusual pheromones to other people. That's the reason why I bought on this site and gave the link to only people who have a certain culture and just want to be the best at evevry moment of the day !
Posting an order was very easy and the experience was good. My complain is more about the delivery follow-up. The delivery was delegated to DHL. For an unknown reason, the delivery boy was not able to find my building at my address. He finally managed to bring back the package to his deposit. Since then, DHL claims that they informed Wiggle but no information came to me. After two weeks with no news, I managed to contact Wiggle whom finally reached DHL for more info and in the end asked me to call DHL. Wiggle should inprove its process to keep updated their clients if issues occur during the delivery process. They should be proactive instead of waiting for their clients to ask for updates.
rien a dire sauf le temps de livraison de la part de la post
Everything was perfect, perhaps one or two mistakes during our trip, especially at the beginning ( no ticket for the first flight)... But all the process was very good and people working in this company are really efficient and soo friendly!!! Good experience and we have recommended soo many times Travel nation to other travellers!!!
Good value cover, had an e-mail problem getting the policy documents, but was sorted immediately by customer services
The difference in quality is obvious as soon as you open the packet, excellent all round service. Easy to order, prompt delivery
le délai de livraison est de plus en plus rapide, pour la plus grande satisfaction du client.
e-outdoor is a great shop, good price and fast shipping! I recommend this shop!
I ordered on  Monday and it was delivered in excellent packaging on Wednesday. The ornamental cherry tree is a very good size and shape and the Jasmine also is a lovely healthy plant.
I have been ordering with naturesbest for a few years now and I have never been disappointed. Top quality products and very efficient customer service. One regret though : that it is no longer possible to track the actual shipping of orders on the site, as it used to be  the case. Another good point: being able to pay with a PayPal account .
Because the eye gel for my cat is discontinuted (i.e. Humigel from Virbac), I have to find urgently an equivalent one. Unfortunately, I have not found a good one here in France. I have found an equivalent one on Chemist Direct. The product name is "Lubrithal Eye Gel" and it is an excellent product and I am happy and my cat too. Thank you Chemist Direct for making this happens. Colette C.
First, I would like to say that the shop is full of interesting things. The big problem in my experience is with the customer service : I'm a french customer, I apply a promotional code which reduces the shipping when I ordered. The day after, the customer service wrote me to ask me 2£ in supplement for the shipping... I've explained to my contact the promotional code and he cames back to me by telling me it was not true... Finally, after 3 or 4 emails, he didn't even recognize I was right. He should just try to make an order as a french customer and put the promotional code to realize what I was telling him was true. I thing that the less the customer service should do, it's believe what customers tell them instead of insinuate they are liars. I will never order again at this shop.
tout c ' est très bien passé de la recherche sur internet à la livraison dans les temps
A bit suspicious at the beginning, I was not so sure to pay 11 euros for a real thing but the website is so made that I felt a bit more confident and finally I decided to spend few euros. And I did not regret them. Code came withtin the announced time frame and more, it worked !!! So, I'm glad to be able now to use my phone with any provider. Thanks to GSM Liberty, higly recommended for people like me in a big s**t with their locked phones. :))
I will always use spartoo, they are always fast and they have a good choice of shoes.
This is a thank you to the Webcreation team who make my website perfect. The hit rate has gone up way over 100% over my old website and I find it easy to edit and change as I wish. The test of a good company is not when things go right but when problems arise. Webcreation responded quickly and effectively each time. With this excellent  service they are loosing money - they are too cheap!
I basically received some quotes 2 weeks later that the initial request. Apparently the transporters received the request with a lot of delay.
I used Glasses Direct because the quality of the glasses are exceptional, the price was unbelievable and the service was really quick. I have used them before and I would really recommend them
Very quick delivery. However, I only ordered a replacement watch strap with a value of £18 so found almost £7 for delivery to France  by recommended post somewhat overkill. Suggest that Babla's offers customers a standard postal service which doesn't need a signature for low value items. That way the postal cost would be more proportionate.
Very satisfied is delighted by your whole site, None problems arise during my commands(orders), Customs charges generally, The delivery a little bit long but postal charges can couteux.... During a command(order) pass before Christhmas it is the only time or we have pus to demand me 10 euros of additional customs charges and I would have wanted to be to pay off if possible... An Article under forms of boxes also without powder has the inside also... His(her,its) fact three years maintaining that I command(order) on Cheapsmells is I had only 2 problems during my commands Donc C' is good... The evaluation remains Excellent!... Thank You very Much!... A faithful customer
I'll get right to the point. Cult Pens site is really perfect on any report. At first I was hesitant to order (with my habits and the fact that it is not in my country of origin, I was afraid of a reception problem) and although I do not regret anything! The site is really secure. We are kept informed of the progress of the package. It really is perfect. No advice can be given because it has everything you need! Much from the service of the contents of really complete site! But, just one thing, sorry for my bad english ;)
c est un site serieux et rapide rien a dire c est parfait merci
The service was fast and the product was as desciribed
Your ease of booking a shipment is wonderful compared to other companies. We have had difficulties in booking a shipment from the UK to France because I was not the shipper but the recipient. I ordered the part from the garage and arranged shipping as opposed to the garage arranging the shipment. Only problem I have had was at the end of the process, I had to put in my e-mail address and then you sent the docs to me in France. Being "not really computer literate", my son managed to sort it out and forwarded to docs to the garage. Otherwise, fantastic. Thank you.
We were looking for wedding bands and came across Baunat's online store. After examining their selection we saw a set of simple yet sophisticated white gold rings which we really liked, but that are normally available only with the purchase of diamond jewellery. Since my fiancée wanted a ring with an embedded diamond I called Baunat to inquire if they could add one. Katrien, the jewellery advisor checked this with a product specialist and quickly informed us that they could indeed make it for us. The rings were promptly prepared, shipped and delivered within 6 working days. They came packaged in a nice shopping bag, including the certificate and slick ring boxes. The rings themselves are beautifully made and finely polished, and the diamond has been inserted perfectly. In the end we found the rings we wanted - diamond and all - available quickly and at lower price than the other store options we saw.
Probikeshop has good selection of products, including Pearl Izumi gear (not easy to find in Paris), all at competitive prices. In this particular case Probikeshop quickly shipped my order; no complaints there. However, it seems that their transporter - Mondial Relay France - had it sent to another pick-up point than what I had selected from their list, which was significantly further than 3 other alternatives spots. There was no clear explanation as to why. In the end I did received my package, but with more inconvenience than expected.
great e-shop, good price, fast delivery, free tax on delivery for 60€. Daily promotions and a large choice of products and tastes. Very good and very serious shop on web for sport nutrition.
awesome service! the only thing you  could improve is the renewal of products which are not currently available, it takes too long before they are again
Que dire de plus , livraison super rapide , merçi purebike
Serenata Flowers made my day. Their online proposition was wonderful, I found them on Google and was redirected through via an advert, their choices on the website were wonderful and the navigation of the site was superb. Once I had chosen my purchase I was thrilled that I could check out easily with PayPal. The flowers were delivered free of charge and arrived the next day at my mums house. I was then emailed to be informed and the email was fun and made me smile. e.g. Maybe it's an old wives' tale, but if you get a ringing in your ear soon, chances are it's because someone's thinking of you - and not just any old someone, but XXX. I thought this was a superb and unique email to send out and it made my day. So not only was my mum happy with the flowers I was happy with the service. Thanks so much and I shall be back !!!! :)
I have ordered a lot of things from Medicanimal. They always deliver promptly. I have never had a single problem with them.
despite the delay announced just after my order, I have received the delivery. You have a good communication department, it is important when you order from abroad. Now I have to test the product! Regards.
Que dire de plus à part parfait en tout point !!
I have told several people about your site and the good prices. I will use you again.
you could buy on this shop, there is no problems
I have bought Skechers shoes from Blackleaf twice, but I would not buy again.  Yes, the shoes are superb, but they are available from other sources.  Yes, the delivery is fast and that is good.   Where Blackleaf falls down is that they just do not reply to questions.  After both my purchases I wrote to them asking if they had the shoes in another colour made by Skechers (and available elsewhere on the Internet). One purchase was via Amazon and the other direct from their website.  On both occasions they failed to acknowledge or respond to my questions even though it would have meant additional business.  That is why I would not buy from them again. Customer service is everything and that is sadly lacking.
The title says it all. I've ordered from allbeauty a few times now and have never been disappointed.
CD Key delivery in time (03/25/14) but scan of the serial key was initialy cropped. Helpdesk has fixed the problem (ticket open today) and they send me the full CD Key by mail. What else... just relax and play for fun
...however, the delivery with TNT Post NL is long an quite poor in terms of tracking.
Car reception was fast. Car was new and clean. Return was professional and fast again.
A wonderful shopping experience, with excellent service, fast shipping and careful packaging of fragile hand-painted porcelain.
Dixons customer care approved a claim for defective laptop and supposedly sent cheque to wrong address, where it was stolen, forged and cashed.  Despite repeated requests, Dixons refused to pursue the matter or provide pertinent info for follow-up with my bank and police. Dixons still owe me £920.80 plus interest! I sent a copy of the file to their litigation department, who have ignored all queries. They're apparently hoping I'll get tired of fighting for my rights and drop the matter. Quick to take your money for an extended warranty; but don't actually honour said warranty.
thank you very much you are the best shipping very quickly good product see you on later
I need a receipt about my purchase and they don't give at all !!
My order was Hamilton Khaki Sunset And Twilight. Itmustbetime was the only website that had really one of this watch in stock. They answer very quickly to email question. They ship outside the US. I give only four stars because I had to wait 3 weeks to get my watch (but I guess that this former model had been a little bit hard). The watch was very well wrapped. A very good experience and really nice prices. I'll be back to itmustbetime!
they are many problem whith the shipping or post office finaly i received the t-shirt 5 week later. I think it's a honest trader but i never shop again on this site because to bad experience can do better.
There are several several websites about american food but this one is the best because there are some items you cannot find in the others stores!
Une prise en charge et un suivi du dossier parfait !
Envoi rapide et soigné en temps et en heure ! Nickel
j ai commandé un service à fondue . Il est parfait . pas decu , livraison rapide
The ordering process and delivery were easy and prompt.  However, the magnets weren't suitable for my requirements.  I had ordered adhesive ones, in order to attach battery lights (which also contained a magnet) to the underside of my kitchen cupboards.   However, because the adhesive side was the same polar as my lights they didn't hold.
The delivery is too slow between UK and France: more than one week; and the delivery price is too high. I don't know what's the trouble with Royal mailing, but it is really annoying. A good idea is to give the ticket nr to follow/trace the packet.
I bought my game two days before the anniversary of my brother (today). I never got the key despite the confirmation of the paypal payment. I'll have to buy the game on Amazon, it was delivered faster...
I was also wondering about the quality and service of this website before ordering a product but they had really impressive prices, so I gave a shot! Now, after having ordered a product I can say that they are excellent!!! My product arrived 4 days after the order, the price was the best on the market and their customer service is fast and efficient! I recommend it without any doubt!!!
site facile à consulter , livraison rapide . A essayer ....
All players, stats, results, videos, the official site of the NBA is the reference for NBA fans !
well structured web, modern, and with high quality photos in all products, very fast shipping to Barcelona, thank you for existing!
Wonderfhul ! I'm verry happy ! It was a nice day when my jacket arrive !
Great prices on this website for UK trains when booking up to one day in advance, we saved nearly 40GBP on a Leeds / Liverpool trip.  Getting the tickets at the station machine was extremely easy as well. I booked from abroad and did not know what to expect exactly, well I was not disappointed and will certainly use Thetrainline services again whenever I need to travel by train in the UK in the future.
Nickel-chrôme, et en un temps record ... Que demander de plus !
very effective service,almost too fast;your website mentioned more than a week for delivery overseas so I was not home when the parcel came.Very satisfactory on the whole however.
Sorry for my english, fortunaly google is my friend ! Axminster site contains everything you need for DIY and it is a correct price when it is not the less cheaper of the other shops. Only downside, some items are not replenished and stay too long out of stock. The replenishment lead times displayed, are not required (exmple: the UJK horizontal featherbords are out of stock for more than three months). It is a pity because otherwise the choice is very interesting  and many items found here are unavailable in FRANCE and that's great!
Was impressed by the fast delivery, even for Belgium. The package was perfect and it was what I ordered
quickly shipped, well protected items, perfect item description match, reasonable price
pas d avis pour l moment   car je ne me suis pas servie d l article
Have used Bodycare2000 before for Paul Mitchell shampoos and tea tree hand soap. Their prices are fair and delivery is quick & efficient.
Bought an Osprey Sojourn 80 wheeled backpack in patina green, which was unavailable at Taunton's price on other websites; delivered within the stated delivery time by courier, fantastic when delivery was free!  Had to speak to the web store as had selected the wrong delivery address, they were extremely polite and helpful.
This is the first time I had come across SafariQuip, where I was able to find an Eagle Creek wash-bag not available through other sites; email confirmations were perfect, same day dispatch followed by free delivery 2 days later with Royal Mail; perfect.
I have used Orca's memory scanner to buy memory for 5 different computers now with a 100% success rate.  Very efficient service and I love the free P&P to Europe, as I live in France.
Decency and objectivity forbid me to grant a five star rating. Even though GolfOnLine  would definitely deserve it.
J ai trouve un site sérieux pour les batteries beaucoup de références et livraison rapide et gratuite super
satkontor.de - Decreases prices but they don't have the promorional items in stock I was recently in germany and i wanted to buy an digital storage and I found out these-ones > satkontor.de so I Searched for theier promotional items on satkontor.de / Decreased prices but unfortunatly they reply with a standard-reply they say "items is not in stock now" and hey suggest an alternative with a non-competitive price so in other words Satkontor.de Decreased / promotional prices ARE A FAKE so we have decided to sign up for AN ONLINE STORAGE SYSTEM LIKE BOX.NET!!
hello all I want to advise you that biovea customers service get annoyed very fast if you want to have the "opportunity" to buy from this "the one comany in the workd - the only 1 comany that sell online!" comany so keep in mind 1) do not ask them questions because the get annoyed very fast and they can decide to ignore your emails and the can "decide" that they "don't want to sell their small stuff"  to you so if you want to use them - don't ask them more than 1 question really!! they don't like that! hehhe 2) looks like they are tring to cover their Real location !! if you ask them the exact item location they simply ignore your questions - By theway i have found from other sources (they don't reply to this specif question) that they probably ship from Poland (EAST "european" country) and NOT from ENGLAND orpakistan, or bangladesh so they try to cover the exact comany location - they probably opened an uk company but they are fisically in Poland so KEEP that in mind 3) don't ask them questions related to shipping modality and never, never ask them questions regarding shipping time! - they DON'T LIKE THAT" so they can "decide" that you "cannot buy" the products - hehhe i think that their comany is stuffed with 1 person only or probably stuffed with middle eastern stuff like from bangladesh or pakistan people because looks like they do-not-know the european procedures I suggest you if you want to buy from biovea.co.uk - biovea.com - biovea-europe.com and other bioveass websites (they have multiple websites with same content!! so in addition they don't even know internet marketing and seo BASICS) do not ask them more than 1 (one) questions - because they get annoyed!!  try them if you don't trust me the world in much bigger han biovea-world, no?
The only problem we had was the long wait to return the car at the airport. Maybe we chose the wrong time.
Very reasonable prices. Very friendly delivery team. The only downside was that the delivery was late and I felt i could have been better informed. However i would still recommend Anyvan to my friends and would certainly yse them again.
The booking went fine, however I didn't want to pay for travel insurance and when I finalised the booking I had a 'pop up ' stating that I hadn't taken out insurance and I had to click one of the boxes, both choices meant you would take the insurance, it's very misleading. There should be a box saying clearly 'I don't want insurance' . Maybe it's the french translation that made it complicated?
Arrived at Aix en Provence at 1.00 pm and left the car park at 1:20 pm with the car. Brand new car in excellent condition and in conformity with our expectations.
Great choice on the store , attractives prices , fast shipping  , what else !!
Perfect product, just use one tablet a day for my personal case.
parfait , en temps et en heure prix correct a renouveler.
I was looking for a tailor made trip to Paris and i found this great package: dinner cruise on the Bateaux Mouches before going to the Crazy Horse. I recommend this website for anyone with an ambitious travel plan.
... tout est dit ! Je reviendrai pour la suite :) Reno
it s very hard to me to write in english . i don t understand why you need lot of photocopy . i think it s all when i give you my number card
When I looked for a rent car on Internet, I found Arguscarhire who proposed very low prices. I was a little bit suspicious. Nevertheless, I received contract very quickly who was clear and detailed. In fact, Arguscarhire is only an intermediary with the big renters because after rent on Internet, I was in relation only with HERTZ with a car and impeccable services for my rent. All was really perfect for the better price that I can found on WebSite.
Everything was OK with my booking at cabrera medina: good web site, competitive prices, car delivered on time at the hotel with a child seat as requested ...
Quick, efficient, cheap .... and works perfectly ! what else ? happy I am :)
Hope the trip will be as pleased as the reservation
This is one of the best ideas to find parts for vehicles from expert companies that know it will fit my auto far better than I do AND all at the best prices... *****THANK YOU PARTS GATEWAY & ALL THEIR PARTICIPANTS*****
very fast shipping . large choice , i would recommend this company. of course.
I'm french and Buyaparcel is the best solution to get product like DEWALT, MAKITA at very low price. The shipping is fast and the return is very easy if you wants to exchange and get another product. Thanks.
The tablets against worms are effective and easy to take so the dogs are content. The tablets are not too expensive and arrived quickly without any problems so we the owners are content. Thank you!
The website Arguscarhire is secure and very efficient and with interesting prices!
Good transaction I preorder Watchdog and I get the key at 15h.
There is really not much to say as this is the ideal solution for creating a fast, reliable a good looking website.
I ordered online when I was in the UK with a good price in pounds and when I put my address in France for delivery the price changed to Euros and I didn't realise on the moment but the conversion made the article à lot more expensive. I called the after sales and they explained that it was because it was to be delivered in France . But why in that case don't you put a delivery charge in shipping instead of increasing the price !!! I wrote and complained and they didn't even answer !!! really confusing way of selling, not very honest and no after sales service !!!
very serious site and the furniture have a very good quality price rate.
I ordered my campagnolo spare parts and it was sent the next day. It arrives at my home in no more than 5 days, UK to France.
Very happy with my new design chairs delivered very fast. Thank you !
Le site est bine fait, la prise de commande est facile et la livraison rapide.
Quick delivery of my psn card, got it by mail less than 5 minutes after the phone verification, paypal available for more security, great site I recommand
Clear offer, good price, good follow up and fast delivery : very good experience.
Pour moi les meilleurs pour internet TV et fixe , et service client parfait .
I recommend this site to anybody. Lower prices and real service : 3 days for shipping between England / South  France ; all guarantees for a foreign buyer like me, it's important. Absolutely no reservations.
tout ce qu'on a besoin quand on est perdu et sans driver
I would recommend this compagny for hassle free ordering and quickly get your goods !
At each order, HH works perfectly. PS: in Belgium, UPS delivery only in the morning without phoning to ask at wich time they may come (like DHL), I prefer Royal Mail.
The person I sent the flowers to was very happy and found them beautiful ! Thanks
quality service. Quick dispatch and delivery and best of all the best prices ever
It is the first time I used Travel Republic and I was very pleased by the result. Best fairs than my usual ones. I will do it again !! Thank you.
un shop qui offre beaucoup de choix et alternatives,un partenaire de premier plan pour accompagner ma passion !
I bought a Precor AMT100i 2 month ago from CardioSales (I spoke with Alex) and I had it shipped to France. The sales representative did everything to get my product delivered to my door in no time. The product arrived in perfect condition, and fairly fast for my overseas location. The biggest advantage was of course the price, I paid it half of the cheapest used one I found in France. Thanks again to Alex and CardioSales for this perfect transaction
Quick good prices  everything fine .. i will not change  my cats are happy too.. ;)
site tres pro super tarif et pour la livraison c'est 3 a 4 jours super site RAS
Super simple & easy to understand website with staff on the end of the phone that have back up to date knoledge on their product. Great prices & super fast delivery too.
I can order from france ! In less than a week I got the item I'd ordered !
cette boite a cigarette est super elle a de l allure
I have nothing but praise for currency solutions, I am writing this on behalf of my father who has used their services on my behalf and that of my partner. I in turn am more than confortable to introduce my clients, I work as an Estate Agent in France. I do not like recommending a service that I have had no experience of myself. Also it is my reputation. But currency solutions earn me gratiude of my clients who have all been happy with their service, but it the personal touch that makes them stand out from all the other currency exchange brokers out there. But they are fast efficient and hard to beat on rate in addition, that makes them numbr 1 for me.
site facile entre commande et reception pas de perte de temps bravo a l'equipe
Je recommande ce site , pour son sérieux , son suivi de commande et de client . Pieces conforme a la commande , et un mot : bravo !
tout est tres bien de la commande a la livraison et a la degustation!
All went smoothly from order to delivery - good experience !
I have seen your products for the first time on sunday, in Birmingham. I bought three rolls of canvas, from Paris on monday... and thursday morning, your plot-it rolls were at home.. along the Loire river... in France ! Congratulations ! and thanks a lot !
so you know this game so fun they got it and for an incredible price
We ordered from Berlin and the clothes arrived us two days after ordering. Good quality and Service.
Smileprint was the only site that had the font I wanted for my business cards, at a very competitive price. Delivery was reasonably fast (4/5 business days) and the cards and correspondence cards were exactly what I wanted. Good choice of paper and fonts, and it's really easy to make repeat orders.
ChemicalUK is my source for Pull In boxers - I always find them at a good price and the shipping fees to France are very reasonable.
The service was very difficult to use: the connection kept breaking up and the site kept jumping back to the beginning of the whole process. The cards I received were not only absolutely not worth their high price (14EUR for 8 cards) but the quality of colors and even edges (they lines in the pictures were smudged) was really bad! Unrecommended.
Great products at a reasonable price but delivery time was unacceptable.
MedicAnimal has very reasonable prices for dog kibbles and the fastest delivery I have experienced compared to any similar sites.
J ai apprecie la patience , la gentillesse , et la reactivite de la conseillere
I didn't trust Teufel a first because I didn't heard of it before. I bought a System 5 THX Select 2 Certified "5.2 Cinema Set" because it was the best price for a true THX Select 2  certified speaker set. I can't leave without it now ! It can compete with other THX sound kit that are 1.5 to 2 time more expensive ! Best quality/price rate ! The only dark stop was the delivery, the DHL (not UPS because it's too big) palette freight wasn't quite handy and I had to move this giant sound kit by myself to my home because they deliver only on the street and not at home (advertised).
I was really happy to be able to book mt suitcase online. The only thing that went wrong is that I never received any email saying that my suitcase was ready for collection at the shop... I had to go to the shop to check whether the suitcase has arrived or not. Thanks!
I.m living in France and it's not the first time i order, it's fast, efficient, there's no mistake in my order and the price is top. What else CAN I ass for?
The only probleme is not at notice of feeting in the shifters boxes The rest is OK
I'm in France and I ordered perfumes (11/24/2010 order : 6798284 and 6798257) for more than 200 USD. Since two months I'm still waiting ! I'm very suprised, because the two parcels are not arrived yet... Forget this website : I tried to have informations, you never have answer (or this kind of answer : please wait...) I do not trust FRAGRANCEX.COM
Order processed quickly and very quickly recue yes I would recommend without hesitation this site to friends
Great price for 7 kW generator and arrived very quickly. Slight problem with an engine mount was resolved quickly with replacement part arriving 2 days later. Why can't every online retailer be like this?
Easy process. Great exchange rate and delivered next day with no problems
But, the taste of whey isolate (raspberry) I ordered does not match my taste
RAS ... de la commande à la réception ... impeccable !
thank you for the rapidity, my cockatiel love his new food xtravital ! very good quality.
Interface is easy, even though too many clicks to commit the transaction. Can be quick though. Rates are comparable to competition. Wished they had IBANs in the currencies I trade ... would avoid extra commissions.
Very efficient customer service and quick delivery to Switzerland, I can only recommend this site
Camelbak products at Probikeshop are #1 . great selection and price. client service is awsome. i have shopped her before and will shop here again !!
The site has excellent offers for hard to find parts and the price is right. Good communications concerning followups.
super contact au tel net et précis livraison 2 jours pas de probleme merci
De la prise de commande jusqu'à la livraison : Parfait !
I bought an item on their website early December. Few days later, I was informed that the item was not available and would not be available. They offered an item for replacement which I accepted... We were December 10. Then, they simply disappeared.. After three weeks awaiting my order, I wrote them. No answer. Early January, I wrote again. No answer. Again later late January, no answer... And three days ago, I received finally my order.. and an email, saying "sorry"...! Well, sorry but never ever again I will order on this website.
I order a GOPRO HERO3 Siver Edition on 17th August 2013, and send my paiement by Paypal. Today, the 20 September 2013, my order is still not processed and ths customer service told me they go to send me my order asap (since 16 days). Today, they didn't have my item in stock and they cannot says me when my package will be ship. I ask to repay me my order, but the customer service didn't answer. Finally i receive a mail the 20 September evening to conftim my refund demand. We are the 15 October so 24 days after and no refund!!! Since 15 days, they answer me they have some informatic problem and i receive the refund under 24h  to 48h, but 15 days after always not refund This shop does not respect the delivery times and does not communicate at all with customer. And not refund. It's a thief website Careful Not order on this shop, pass your way
I suggest you to look at free delivery options for other countries that Luxemburg and France. I'm located in Sweden and I would buy more from you if there is a free delivery option with a minimum spend like 100€.
What more can I say?  Everything about my purchase from Carpet Vista has been more than satisfactory - the assistance with my order, the communication with the support team, the hassle-free delivery and the quality of the rugs. I could also mention that the images of the rugs on the website were so good that I could choose with confidence. I would definitely recommend buying from Carpet Vista.
i am booking with hostelworld from more than two years ago and the service is perfect good continuation for them
My order for an indoor car cover arrived within 48 hours.  It was exactly what I'd asked or and the cover is exactly what I wanted. You can't fault the service and the product is spot on. I would definitely recommend them.
super , nickel , site bien fait et livraison tres rapide
prix , livraison et montage , parfait ! que dire de plus ?
It is always a great pleasure to receive my small boxes from cheapsmells.
Fast delivery of cheap costumes that need retouching because of mediocre quality. But that's probably why they're cheap! So to be able to costume up for an event without paying the shirt off your back, Jokers Masquarade is a good choice!
I do not have the time to go out shopping and I love a good bargain so Secret Sales ticks all my boxes! I can browse SS on my home computer under the pretext of "working". The products are top quality and the prices are affordable. I now have my husband addicted too! Only wish SS shipped to Europe.
des frais de port meme pour plus de 400 e pas top
Secure purchase and good product (like on the picture) ! + : receive your parcel in France and other countries.
I love to spend HOURS to compare rates, hotels, and flights; and Alpharooms comes first for the hotel prices: they have rates unseen elsewhere, and they are easy to use: with the combined rating of TripAdvisor I booked a hotel in the best location at the best price in Tallinn, Estonia (somewhere I have never been to). It is my second order with them. My first order was a bit worrying though: the airplane tickets took 2-3 days to arrive in my email box, so now I am only buying the hotel (and I take a separate insurance for the lot: airplane + hotel & medical/evacuation/etc). I know that they currently have holidays booking with just a deposit: I didn't try that yet, but will for my next holidays. Thanks Alpharooms!
this site is neither transparent nor fair, it is almost always beside seller agaist the costumer; delamaison.fr is known as the worst sells site in France but it has the full protection from Trustpilot
Je ne recommande pas du tout ce site pour les creations
The service is really easy to use. I made two transactions from the UK to France so far and both went perfectly.
My husband meant well by ordering from them for my birthday. But the bouquet never arrived on my birthday. He was very vexed. When I finally got the flowers, not one flower looked healthy. All had some sort of damaged. When I consider the priced he has paid for them... totally not worth it.  When he contacted them to ask where his order was and why it was late. They blamed the local florist. I took pictures in case Teleflora is interested in how the flower they deliver look like. Unacceptable to run a business in such manner.
We had to cancel 6 rooms we booked for a group trip and they debited the money out of our account anyway. The hotel did, yet we cancelled within the time frame of the cancellation policy. Although we respected the cancellation policy and cancelled on time, Hotels.com gave our card details to the hotel and the hotel debited more than the prices of the rooms booked (600€), causing us major problems with our bank. It has been 2 weeks since the cancellation and we are still struggling with Hotels.com to get our money back. It is thievery. They keep lying to us, saying they will call us back, yet they never do. We have called them 8 times, sent many emails... Proper ROBBERY!!! DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM, THEY ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS.
Booked ticket for my dad's birthday and long time dream of seeing a rugby game in Cardiff... I paid £195 per ticket and on top of this exorbitant price I paid for delivery (to France so something around £10) and over £70 commission for Seatwave. To my great surprise, I received the tickets and realised they actually cost £75. I was flabbergasted, shocked and angry. I paid for two tickets, so I gave Seatwave a total extra of 240+70 that is £310... If I had known I would have taken the ticket elsewhere and paid the actual price: £150. This is thievery. No other words. And I can't do anything about it because this evil company has excellent defence... well must have the money to get amazing lawyers considering how they are ripping people off.
I used AnyVan twice. To move my stuff back to France. I moved 5 years of my life in the UK for under £200... my bike included. Nothing was damaged during transportation, in both trucks and cargo. Would use it again if ever needed.
de la commande a la livraison pas de temps perdu et les points de montage indiqués pas de surprise qualité de travail et prix indiqué sur internet respecté
recommended by a friend when we wanted an over night stop in Spain on our way to Portugal so when we were looking for an hotel in Majorca we compared lots of sites and you came up best again.
This was a great priced car and the sevice was terrific, friendly and efficient, will use them again.
Thank you for the tyres, arrived quickly and we are very happy with them and the garage who fitted them.   We will tell all our english friends about your great service. Jean
I receive my order in Paris only three days after !
excellent service, pas de frais de port et livraison ultra rapide !
My key was sent in less than 1minute. I would recommend it to all my friends. This site is the best you can find on the net for purchasing CD Keys.
j ai eut l occasion de faire un livre photo grace a toluna super encore merci
Une belle idée sur un beau projet pour la nature et le titre de Lord ou ou Lady pour le fun ! Tout y est !!!
j'adore regarder en replay car pas toujours le temps de tout voir ! super !
This site are very bad because I give all description of my car and this site send me bad piece !!! I cherch to call and he have no number for call on the site. I send mail message and I have no response I find phone number to this company and whan I call a people ask me to call to a number all time occuped. This site are very dangerous be carrefull
The delay was long to ship from UK to France : 13 days. But the packaging was very good, as the last time.
les prix , la rapidité de livraison , impeccable .
Good price for hight quality products and very fast delivery for France No reservations, I recommand this company
2 weeks after i paid for a ATH_a900 i have not receive it I email why they answer "out of stock" the ath-a900 is still on the site and "in stock" now i try to have my money back by Paypal i am not the first victim search on the web and you will see that other peoples were in the same situation
A bit finicky choosing the page formats and fitting the photos in. Very happy with the result. Everything went well and I expect to repeat the experience.
Would have appreciated an Install Guide ( which way for airflow ) on a washable filter.
this website is very useful, you can find a lot of parts and the schema are available control the price before buying because the price are expensive but sometimes you can't find the parts anywhere than cmnsl
site super simple et efficace pour donne son avis et se faire un avis sur un marchand
They understand the word service better than any other company on the internet. The ordered products arrive on time. Cancellations easy, even if the reason is "I made a mistake." When buying goods from another company, AMAZON give an assurance, in the event that the company is being difficult. BRITA I wrote earlier (BRITA leaks) was prepared after weeks to send a part of the bad product. Amazon took back the complete order,  they payed the return postage and refunded me the FULL amount!! AMAZON IS WORTH A PLATINUM LABEL. Its staff is very helpful and competent. A MODEL FOR ALL INTERNET COMPANIES.
From a single drawing I made, Steve proposed more than 10 different versions and probably 25 to 30 variations - all very interesting. In two weeks I got a Logo that perfectly represents my company and its values ! What can I say more than the Trustpilot definition of 5 stars rating ? Perfect – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.
I have been asked by trustpilot to alter my review of pet planet..So basically I made an order to France, 1 parcel turned up , they other went missing for 7 days, everyday pet planet told me its arriving tomorrow, its arriving tomorrow....SO after waiting in 6 days until 6 oclock at night, some nice phone calls to pet planet , some not nice at all, treating me like a piece of dirt on her shoe...7 international phone calls ;later...the parcel didnt arrive, I asked for a refund on the bag of food and all shipping costs, which they agreed to, and they arranged for the food to be returned...Next day whilst Im out the parcel turned up, my husband signed for it...SO I send an email to pet planet , what do i do with the parcel, Ive already ordered food elsewhere, as you never sent the voucher you promised to send, where is the refund you promised, where is the voucher you promised, no reply, next email no reply...Here we are still no reply...ANd this is a customer who spends around 180 pounds a month at per planet...The cause of all this pet planet misprinted the label on the second package and because of that I lost 4 days of work and now have to pay for 7 international phone calls, no refund , no voucher, no explanation why..and no idea what they want me to do with the bag of food, they had arranged to send back to UK......HOW WONDERFUL..!!!!!
I went to Istanbul for the first time for my operation. It is a beautiful city and food is amazing. The hotel they took me to was absolutely clean and new. The staff was friendly and helped me many times. The Surgeon and their team were definitely professional and experienced. They explained me every stage clearly and made me feel comfortable. I was nervous at the beginning but when the operation started, I immediately felt relaxed. I was already convinced that I will be in professional hands before, but seeing the hotel, clinic, an experienced surgeon and smiling people, you are feeling that you have done the right choice. I have already advised Gethair to some colleagues and totally recommend it to anyone. Merci.
very fast delivery (i live in France) lot of mails to tell you where is your item very good product (omega 8004). no problem at all
service super livraison respectee super service rare de nos joiurs
I was really satisfied. The people at the airport were efficient and polite. We travelled with a 6 month baby and they could provide us with a special seat. The only thing I regret is that you sign the papers without seeing the car so I discovered the car had a big scratch on the side once I was alone, I would had appreciated that this would be written in the contract. But my global opinion is good and I recommand.
Excellent company just one small thing - the plastic cover that you put on when the towball is detached was broken on delivery,  the packaging could have been little better.  I trust tow equip will forward me anew one
An oscilloscope with logical input less than 500€ delivery inside is the Best price I've ever seen. Batronix is a very good merchant.
One of the best selection of gear with the best prices. Service is outstanding and deliveries alway fast. Can only recommend!
Hi I ordered 3 perfumes, I got only one of them, the other two were sent and lost in the mail service. Allbeauty got them back, I asked them to send them again, never received. I keep sending mail, no information on delivery date, I am tired as one of they perfume was a chrismas gift for my spouse. I just asked for a refund ,I'll keep you informed.
service technique au top pour la réponse aux questions posées et livraison en temps et en heure, merci
I wanted some knobs to match those on an old English pine dresser, and as I live in France I had a fruitless search as styles are different here. Handles 4 Doors had exactly what I wanted at a very competitive price. The order process was simple and delivery was phenomenally fast, arriving here in just 3 days. The porcelain knobs were very well and safely packed. Recommended.
J aime louer surtout les appartements, ou il n est pas nécessaire de payer la caution ou ceux ou la caution n est pas trop elevee.
Maybe a little bit too much options (like departure time from 00:00 to 23:00, kind of useless). Could be updated like "morning/afternoon" or automatically recover the available departure time from the route and date previously chosen.
I have order 09 dec 2013 , 2 pants blackhawk and a sumer jacket condor.  Waiting 2 months because one item was not in stock and promised a 7 to 10 days delivery time. I  mention the fact i have no problem to wait. But it seems the reap-provision time is quiet elastically !!! also a need to cancel my order first and reorder later for the same items. And this time, houra delivered after 3 days more than perfect. Anyway , you have to be patient... but many thanks for  the sale team effort to follow up orders .
Que dire de plus que: parfait de bout en bout.
Rien a dire tout est parfait , les prix , le service livraison
A good experience. I will use this website again and again.
I've been to the site just for the fun when I read about it, I want it to do more, well done, It's clever, it's witty... several thousands of owners !!! so clever !!! I Love it, Thank you for Scotland
My order was really quickly pispatched, I received it as quickly as if it were sent within its original country. The products are really carefully wrapped and protected, they arrived in perfect condition. I'm totally satisfied and I know I will order on Beaute Choix again.
j attend de voir la réponse de la société LDLC pour donner un avis
forces : Cost effective, availability and fast delivery. weaknesses : no posibility after placing an order to check/change the delivery adress. No tracking of shipping. No french plugs adaptator.
I have bought a few products and the quality of the Thermostatic shower mixer valves excellent, after sales service great too, would highly recommend.
Goggles arrived within a couple of days, and at a great price, very impressed.
Satisfied to get a choice of ferries from and to different destinations all on one website. Fairly straight forward booking system and immediate confirmation of details. Happy Chappy.
despite severela phone calls and the expiry of a 20 workings days period, I did not received my order....
Smart Google accounts product for sharing your experience for free on Google earth
My website done in 3 hours with CMS Wordpress, sharing my pictures  with JAlbum in a quarter, how could be a better place..
Am addicted to Beauty Bay, they have a fantastic range of products and brands at good prices.  Orders are processed very speedily, and international shipping to Europe is extremely reliable and quick. The customer service team is also quick to solve any problems (although rare). Couldn't ask for more, keep going back!
Pretty large selection of hard-to-find beauty products in one place (like HealGe and Omoroviczal ), and some good promotions that make it worth your while.  Delivery to Europe is a plus. No problems with delivery, although you have to be patient with standard delivery as it can take a while. order nb 25029718.
I made an order which was paid with my debit card. I never received any confirmation of that order.... but a few days later, 97% of my order was refunded... still no explanation. At the beginning of the week, I sent a message to the store asking for an explanation and giving (again) my email address, and my cell number.... Still nothing. No message, no explanation... and NOT 100% of refund.... i'm still missing money.... and of course, I never received any of my order. I would NOT recommend that store.
The site is very clear, easy to navigate, and secured for payment. Shipping was fast and well packed. Perfect ! Kids were happy to find their usual products they had been missing since their arrival here.
I ordered a Bern helmet one day, the next day it was delivered and 5 days after, it was on m head to bike on France's roads.
My order was delivered very fast. The product is conform with my request and the price is very attractive
I bought some articcles from france and i am very happy: price are better than paris, and come in less 1 week. Perfect
I bought Liebherr Vinotek WKb 4212 a month ago from the Tanglewoodwine Website. The price was really interesting. I've got 2 contacts by email after placing my order and a also a call to manage the delivery. My wine cabinet was delivered 5 days after my order by professional staff from LIEBHERR. Also they have set up the appliance to be ready to use. I would recommand Tanglewoodwine to buy any wine cabinet.
I have received email, text and phone calls from Vesternet and they were always happy to amend my orders or give advice on the right products.  Delivery was a bit slow though and payment on sage pay failed the first time but this was promptly corrected.
It was great to travel inside london and see almost all monuments in a single course. We appreciated also the boat which gave us another sight point. A great experience.
I Tried a lot of websites, but for me BP is the best one, good products, verry quick ( 2 days to receive !!), they answer very fast if you need to know something... Thanks !
The order arrived quickly, and I have no complain about the products I received.  however the delivery company used has a very poor communication system. They sent me an email the day before the delivery was due, because they don't deliver on Saturday, I could not reschedule for another of the week (when you work evryday 9-5, the delivery system is definitely not convenient).  They did deliver on the day they were supposed to do so, and left the parcel with my neighbour. However they did not leave a card for this. if my neighbour did not come to give it, I would have still been waiting for the parcel...!
I hired a car via 'Vuelling' with budget (part of Avis) at Lyon airport and got my car for a week. I filled up the tank before giving back the car at the petrol station at the airport; with that in mind, they managed to charged 25 euros of petrol and saying that the tank was full at 7/8!! what a band of liars!! How come a distance of less than a kilometre would use a 1/8e of a tank!! So Avis, National Citer and now Budget.. they all charged me for 'unreal' petrol charged! and the worse and what annoys me the most is that every time I ask for their staff to come and check the car with me when I give the key back, and no one wants to come! It is ripping off people and taking advantage of them because we are all in a hurry to go to the terminal! a shame!! I would NEVER hire a care again from any of these companies and would definitely not recommend!
Only put 4 stars because the description of the shoes was not complete, which is I think a downside of Spartoo. But Still, I am very pleased with my new pair of boots! and the delivery was fast, as they said, in less than 6 days. i would definitely recommend this company!
Some difficulties because billing and shipping address should be the address of credit card owner (so why the system allows different addresses for shipping and billing ?). The article arrived timely and at an attractive price despite relatively high shipping cost.
Des frais indecents et ni service client pas a la hauteur
best just in time ! best price ! best delivery ! what else ???
Sue se soit au niveau de la coupe de la taille ou de la livraison tt est ok

receive a very little Fiat 500 for 4 adult in place if a Peugeot 207 or similar as described. The peugeot is really bigger then the Fiat.
Range ot products really imaginative -- I don't know how you manage to find them all for your catalogue. I always seem to end up by ordering more products than I originally thought, but that's because the catalogue is like Alladin's cave full of goodies. There was a bit of a hitch (probably my fault) over internet-payment from the website, but your helpdesk staff were really cheerful, polite, patient and helpful. Pay them more ! International delivery was efficient and quick, and the products all arrived in good condition.
At the beginning of my experience with Rebtel i put a 5/5. But now, after a 3 months experience approximately, i cant say the same. - Drawbacks: * NR1:  i use Android, and if i use the Rebtel app with my android smartphone, i make a phonecall for example in Europe, Africa..hte connection is not always that good,BUT, above all, if someone calls me ath the same time with my mobile, my connection is cut !! I must call again and so on, and i am losing some seconds and even minutes the more the connection is cut - NR2: Rebtel compagny has ceased, as they told me per email, to develop their software for windows on PC. VERY BAD DECISION. At least, when i used Rebtel on my pc, the connection was not cut, unlike with android. And it has nothing to do with the settings because first of all i checked all my settings, second, if you use other voip services, the connection is not cut when you use their app and if someone calls you on your smartphone at the same time. NR3: their rates are average, not that cheap actually, but just average. Conclusion: The Rebtel app needs to be improved!
I find Hostelworld super easy to use, fuss free, and it has all of the information I need. Very user friendly and I highly recommend.
I appreciated the information about the delay, very nice !
I ordered and paid (£ 5,080) a BREGUET 3820TI/K2/TW9 March 9th on the website dialawatch.co.uk and I still have not received my order (we are July 14). I phoned them the July 14 and they have never called back  me to give the progress of my order. They try to make me wait and continually retreating delivery date. With no return on an application for final date, I decided to get a full refund. Now I await reimbursement while disappointed: I'd rather the watch. I had a return by e-mail on July 16th: he(it) make a refund and at the same time they try to have the watch. I thus wait for the refund by July 22nd at the latest. On July 22nd, I received the promise of an immediate refund. On July 28th I am in wait. We are now August 4th and I still have no refund. I try again to contact them... We are 11 aout and not the slightest track of refund in spite of their promise. August 22nd, always no refund September 5th, always no refund September 9th, I am paid off: I have make opposition to the payment of the Visa card (transaction canceled). I do not know if DIALAWATCH really sells watches
Appalled at the service I've received from Travelbag - OK I understand that flight availability is unpredictable, but the fact that they take 3 days to let a customer know is pretty much a joke. Plus it is less than transparent when you book on the website. I only noticed there was a 72h delay when they emailed me after I paid for my trip. After 72H my flights were cancelled and was left with skyrocketed prices. Their customer service is useless and almost rude. Had to rant on Facebook to have their attention but even like this, they weren't even apologetic. It is about time they rethought the stone age processes they currently have in place. Ended up booking with [External Reference]!
I just ordered a small item ( jumbo grip for putter ) but it was delivered within 5 days from UK to France
I bought a Callaway golf bag for my wife - I found the best price on the net at Golfstore Europe  for this bag and adding nice pink lady golf balls I got free delivery.

I ordered two jumpers at a slightly reduced price in the Debenhams sale and promptly got an email confirmation of the order. The next day I received another email saying that they were unable to fulfil the order due to stock availability. When I looked at their website a week later the very same items were still for sale except that they were at a higher price so it was nothing to do with stock availability at all! Speaks for itself really. This is not the first time I have had this experience when shopping online at Debenhams and shall now avoid them totally to avoid the hassle and the disappointment.

Used Olotels for the first time and the hotel, price and reservation process were 100% as advertised so I would definitively recommend their reservation service!
I ordered the Le Corbusier 3 seater sofa, armchair and an egg pod chair. Having not checked under the sofa, I didn't notice that one of the main struts/supports was not welded in place or maybe the weld had broken. It was carefully packaged so it"s unlikely to have happened in transit. (ps. If ordering, ensure you have enough hands on deck to deal with large packing crates, as the delivery driver just dumped them in the street.) I almost forgot - while we're talking about the delivery "service". I was told that the delivery would be wednesday morning between 9 and 12 or if he couldn't make it, it'd be friday morning between 9 and 12. I therefore took wednesday morning off work, and awaited in the apartment. At approximately 11am on wednesday he phoned to say he wasn't coming. Half a day of holidays wasted. Friday rolls around. I have a friend come to the apartment between 9 and 12. We wait until 11h45 before I get a little annoyed and call the delivery company, only to be told that there's been a problem and he's not coming. The driver got lost in Bordeaux allegedly, but neither phoned me for directions, nor called to say he wouldn't make it. They then said they could come that afternoon, between 14h00 and 14h30. Another half day of holidays wasted. Back to the flaw: When I wrote to report this flaw, I was told to ship the sofa back to SPAIN, at my own expense, and they'd evaluate the item. No guarantee of a refund of shipping costs. I'd say this is pretty poor customer service. I like their products, the egg pod chair is particularly great, but following this experience I'd be cautious of ordering again unless a satisfactory resolution is reached.
I live in France, and am used to ordering online from UK and US stores with no issues, but this struck me as unusual, taking payment THEN asking for proof of address. Just disappointed as I'd rather have given MonsterSupplements my business than H&B.
ce sera parfait si on envoie un mail de confirmation après une commande passé .
la commande sur le site , riche en differents articles est rapide . tout comme la livraison a domicile en 48h
in the box you will find exactly what is advertised, at the exact cost , and delivery to France couldn't be faster ! I will come back !
Completely satisfied, very well packaged products and fast delivery even to France!
I have used HiFx for 2 or 3 years now and have been impressed each time at the speed and efficiency of the service.  They deserve their well-earned reputation.
After a pretty extensive research on internet ToolStop came to me as the best price / most reliable reseller of Metabo Tools in Europe, I'm French. Their Youtube videos also helped to establish trust, the Scottish accent maybe ... certainly. Order was easy, shipping cost surprisingly low at 20€ for 3 machines from Glasgow to Bayonna, arriving just 3 days latter with DHL, well packed, no mistake : Pure dead brilliant !
on y trouve tout , c est infernal !! J adore

hello after having bought a barely arma3 key has received the installation: I was told that this key are already in use and it's been four days that I made this expense Still no games and the top no I do not know if I buy it back on this site
A pleasure to deal with. Quick and friendly service. What else can we wish for ?
recommended to me through ukv as good a service as most say would have no worries using this company again or recommend to friends.
I had rent the car via another website with 0 franchise and all insurance. At the Maggiore agency in Napoli stazione centrale, they tried to sell me an extra-insurance, pretending i was not covered against theft (which was a lie). Then i found out the tank was not full as it was supposed to. I instantly notified it to the agency, and they pretended the petrol gauge was not working (which was a lie). So, beware.
Web site clearly displayed the part I needed. Delivery was as stated. Item received and installed without any problem.
My son was born a tiny bit to early for us to have everything ready and babycare customer service really made my life easier on the stroller front. One of the items I ordered was not in stock anymore but they helped me figure out my options so that I received everything I needed in a week's time. As I was having trouble assembling a spare stroller piece, they even sent me pictures taken in the factory to solve my problem !
I live in France and still found it better to buy from these guys...
I recently added 4GB of RAM to my ASUS Notebook. The online selection tool provided on Offtek website was a breeze to use in order to select the right memeory module adapted to my notebook model. After ordering on line, I received the module at home 3 days later, it installed with no issue and operating to full satisfaction.
almost everything is in the title... Easyjet is a LOWprice company, with LOWquality service, who doesn't give the slightest damn to its customers, treating them like sh...  , practicing overbooking (illegal) as a way of leaving, cancelling flights as easily as snapping fingers, without any bad thoughts for the people they leave behind : no explanations, no excuses, no solutions, a jungle fight to get the money back.... I personnaly will make as much bad publicity about Easyjet as I can, they're not a flight company , they're just money makers.

After a hiccough with the wrong lens and my coming home to France, the service couldn't have been better. My new glasses were corrected and returned to me in double quick time and they are perfect! I am really impressed with the care and thoughtfulness of the dispensing opticians. I will definitely be calling on the services of Glasses Direct again and won't hesitate to recommend them to my friends and family.
I have received half of my order and I am still waiting for the other half. Requested an update and I have not received an update on my order yet

Bought a snowboard jacket at a discount, arrived a day later and it was exactly what I wanted. Considering it was my first purchase it does deserve a 5-star rating.

Received a really beautiful Chinese "antique" style rug from Rug Vista.  It was prettier than the photos.  It's more like a work of art. There was a brief U.S. Customs delay but Daniel kept me informed in a very professional and plesant way and he fixed the problem quickly.  Would buy from them again.
I would for sure use rental cars for a future rental. Had a good and recent car and they were the best value for money i could get on the net.
I ordered a MTB Chain and a Chain-tool. The chain came quite quickly, but the tool (which is actually mandatory to deal with the chain!) is still pending 12 days after order...
It's the best way to share my creation and my likes
I ordered BF4 for a really small price, and received the key fast :)
Hi this is the worst company I have ever had to deal  with .
The Light Bulb Company offered a great range of products at reasonable prices. They delivered the product ahead of time and it was extremely well packaged.
hello I quote your order on for some time and I find that quote, complete and parts you want even an old 200 tdi Défender found thank you to all the teams paddock
Price are really nice, accurate informations ans follow up and fast delivered.
I ordered 2 DVDs and they turned up in record time, especially in view of the fact that I live in rural France.
Being able to do the transaction on line,i.e. fully automated when you have an account is good and works well and quickly. However, they usually give a rate that is around 2 to 2.25 cents below the money market rate whereas others only 'take' 1 1/2 to 1.25 cents. That 1/2 cent or so per £ can make quite a difference if you are changing £1000's. When exchange rates are less volatile I would rather deal with my French bank as they give a better rate, but you cannot fix it on the day, you have to see what rate they can give when your £s arrive in your account and these days it end up lower than Hifx even with a delay of just 3 days. You have to catch the market right !
This is a very useful on line facility and through them it is possible to get 'favourite' products that one cannot easily get at, say, high street chemists and supermarket pharmacies
Produit conforme a la description facile a mettre en place .
Good shop with nice and rare goods. A bit pricey but quality is there. Good customer service with constant intel on order availbility.

hello i have just bought a caska product (ca 191 a) for my kia sportage and it does not really works. I have sent mails to coagent / caska : sales@caskaglobal.com and info@caskaglobal.com but they did not answer me, now that i have problems !!

tout est parfait, de l'envoie a la réception, en passant par les info ou par le service client.
I ordered two items with slower free shipment announced as 6-7 days, but I received them in 4 days. Great jobs.
la commande est très facile a passer !!! la livraison est ultra rapide! merci beaucoup de ce service
Nice to know that some of the good things in life are just a few days away, with the click of a few buttons. It's great to be an "ex-pat", so many new sensations, new people, new places. But when you are in far away places, there are some things you can't get, and it's nice to know that British Corner Shop can come up with those little things that you miss from "Home", and can make life so ..... so .... ( I lack an adjective here !)
Although the flowers were great and in fact delivered, and the recipient was very happy with them, I had indicated a single request and it was not honored with no reason why and with no apology. I specifically asked (in both English and Dutch) that the flowers not be delivered before noon, and it turns out the flowers were delivered even before 10am. If this kind of request cannot be honored, I would at least like to be told before delivery.
Pas de problème, paiement facile et livraison rapide par mail !
We ordered glasses while on holiday in france and had them delivered in under a week. No fuss and great service.
We ordered an Egg chair with piping in creme leather in November 2013. Several delays in delivery process lead to a delivery at mid/end February 2014. When the chair arrived, we realized the leather seating cushion was not the same color than the chair itself (several tones difference). After informing Voga who responded through several robot-type mails (not answering our questions), we finally filed a claim to which they answered by mentioning they would get back to us in 10 days with a solution. Two weeks later I had to pursue them myself. They replied by email asking if I would be ok to receive another cushion in the right color???? I asked the person if she really needed a fortnight to come up with this common sensed solution! We are currently at the beginning of June 2014 and I still have not heard back from the company. I trusted the Trustpilot reviews but I'm beginning to wonder whether the good rates are done by real private individuals or not... ***************************************************************************** Following this message, Voga's customer service got back to us immediately, sending us the right colored cushion + reimbursing the chair. We are happy with this solution although as we mentioned to them, it's really a pity that the use of social media is obviously the only way to impulse a reaction from their services. Thanks to Voga anyway for this solution. This is why I passed from two points to three.
rien a dire de site très sérieux et pas de retard dans la livraison
IL manque un article dans la livraison ,aucune réponse a mon mail de réclamation !
Cheaper price and simple reservation. The search engine is also the best on the web.
My order was quickly and efficiently shipped (UPS) and very good prices. Only drawback, comments I putted in order have never been read neither taken care of :(
Made two orders mid-November 2012 with long delivery times. Kept that in time but started getting worried a few weeks ago. The 1st order has "been sent" according to what I can see on my account through the Infurn site. The tracking leads to DHL's site but the numbers are false. Since with my own firm I was a regular client of DHL I still have contacts and checked the tracking with DHL, those number do not exist!!! Moreover, the shipping address has been changed to a wrong one (the one for witch I made the 2nd order but not the 1st). Why??? Sent email to Infurn more than a week ago. Got an automatic return mail but nothing else. Still waiting. The second order made on Nov 16th has bern changed by Infurn on March 23rd - without any notice! - by Infurn into a product voucher worth less than my initial order!!!! However, that voucher has still not bern sent. How long really does it take to send a voucher???? Why worth less than the initial amount? Do they really think that after all this waiting and being treated like non-existed I would accept a voucher? I want a full refund!!! Like anyone of us who have been treated this bad by this company.
I have been looking for a Les Paul look alike. and the description by Guitabitz was informative and spot on. The Vintage V100 is exactly as described an excellent guitar at this price point.. Together with the Vox amp a brillaint combo. The service to France was impressive (3 days). The parcel was really well packaged and the guitar had even been tuned.
I recommend this store to anyone liking high class tissues
It is not my first purchase with CJC CD Keys and I never had problems. I received my key within 5 minutes, had time to preload the game before the D-DAY and I'm now ready for TITANS fighting !
First time I ordered on this site and I am really impressed ! Highly competitive prices (I just don't dare to buy any tools somewhere else when I see the difference, even with the shipping expenses to France !). I started assembling tool boxes for my three sons and did not want to invest too much but without sacrifying on the tool quality. Toolstop makes my dream reasonnable and I will most certainly order again in the future to complete my son's tools. Thanks !
Great to find a UK company that will post to Europe with affordable  postage rates and all products very good quality - can't buy for this price in France.
Nothing to add, everything was perfect and the same as the website
beaucoup de choix et de marques de parfums, livraison ok
tout est parfait , les produits , les fiches détaillées, la livraison rapide , les prix intéressants.
i was searching for some running shoes that are not too expensive, and found this website! I never saw a website as fast as this one. Easy to browse and compare the cheapest product. It looks really good and so easy to use! i would recommend it whithout any doubts to all my friends
Good service as always from Jane de Boy and so nice to have a 20% discount this time.
il suffit de regarder voir meme de comparer et tout est dit
j ai commander une fois et je n ai pas eu de probleme avec ce site , l article commander est des crampons pour l hiver ,

Very pleases with the quality of the goods,the colour was not quite true to the real thing,but thatis probably the same with any goods.
Everything happenedp just as promised,and my furniture,which was very precious to me(my late mother,s) waslovingly and carefully wrapped and collected at the time arranged(very important as a third party was involved), and the driver kept me posted as to progress as the furnitur had to be brought to France.Delivered on time, with a smile,no damage and a very good price.Can,t fault the service and would use them again anytime.Many thanks for all your,care.
. ups does not leave a notice in the mailbox and delivers the neighbors even when we are present. prefer the relays. attention to the right of retraction
I think that when everything it's ok, then it's hardly noticed: people remember when a problem was fixed, and maybe forget when there was no problem at all and all the hard work to make that possible. Well, this is the case: everithing - payment, shipment, tracking, delivery, and my wonderful Arc'teryx jacket - was perfect. Thank you!
I received my order in 9 days from England to France! It's really fast and the item was exactly the one I ordered. Of course, I'll order again in this shop.
I was suspicious with these websites selling a lot of products, but Yesstyle is selling very good quality products, and we know where they come from. It has a lot of services (conversions, matching products, etc) and the shipping fees are free ! They also communicate in a very good way and they reply very fast to any mail I have sent to them. They are trying their best to get your product even if they don't have it quickly, and in the case the product is out of stock, they give a refund very fast. I will continue to buy on YesStyle in the future.
I ordered a Corima wheelset in january and i received it only now in may 2014. It's a bad surprise but it seems that the delay were not due to Slane Cycles. It's not interesting to wait about ...4 months! In fact when i ordered the wheelset Gavin, the manager say me that they had not in stock but normally they will received it from 2 to 3 weeks...Finally i had them yesterday the 5 th of may. In same time i had many interactions with Gavin by mail and phone and he was very polite , answer each time. And i try to believe that it was due to delays independant of his goodwill. But it's sure that Slane Cycles, in my mind, must ameliorate their internet site. They must indicate if yes or no the merchandise is in stock  as many other internet site which sell bicycle and bicycles parts. It's absolutely mandatory to know exactly if there is a chance you must wait or not. And when you know directly on the site if what you want is available or not is essential. In my case i had to phone to verify if yes or no the wheelset was available. It was not but as there was a promotion Gavin say me that i must order now to be eligible to that promotion. For that reason (and as explained before , at that time, he thinks he must receive the wheelset in a delay between 2 and 3 weeks) i order. And  you know the following. But i say again that Gavin in such circumstances was very correct and i am sure he try to do what he can
Nothing further to add. They sell  - you buy - no quibbles delays or excuses, and delivery estimates are accurate even overseas.
hi I know and Ibuy  cycling parts in a very performed shop , you must try  that label for your futur  purchases , the   name  is :  CUSTOMISED BIKES . COM me , I'm very glad about my purchases and the serious from them so long friendly Patrick
Although you have the full model number of the tyre the system does not ask if you want run flat or not. Consequently the guy shows up with a non-run flat for a car that needed run-flat. I guess I can take some responsibility myself but I believe the system should ask you duringthe ordering process "Run Flat - tick here" for example. Had to re-schedule and re-order the tyre. Must admit, the company was very helpful and handled the situation very well, henc ethe rating
They are clearly very well engineered and very well built. Real German quality and the innovative design of the outer facade lifting away to leave the galvanised bin to be emptied is excellent.
site a recommander de la commande a la livraison tout est parfait bravo en plus le site est tres facile  merci
The products are of good quality and as described on the website. Delivery is fast. I will recommend to buy with Naturesbest in the future.
Excellent customer service. Fast, efficient, polite, helpful,... Nothing to say except : FANTASTIC ! We only had a very simple order (a pair of hotsocks for my wife) but problem was : we live in France. After a few emails in the morning, easy payment via paypal, gift was sent the same day and received the day after in excellent condition. Never seen such a great customer service. Wish we had something like that in France.
I recommend this site very good for online purchase. I passed more than ten order and I have always been very satisfied with my purchases. In case of problems the customer service is very responsive and always provide solutions. the prices are very attractive and there are many choices on the site. I will order again soon ;-)
Very easy sopping, with accurate infos. Fast and secure shipping. I strongly recommend soactive to any girl looking for sports apparel
Livraison rapide et conforme, en un mot service : impeccable !

Beautiful flowers; delivery took a little longer than planned, but the wait was worth it!
All the items that I bought were really good value, so very pleased on that front. The delivery charge though was £1.50 more than it should have been and it always takes such a long time to arrive which I don't understand considering I can have packets delivered from other companies using the same posting method that come in less than half the time. 3 stars because of delivery concerns but it wouldn't stop me using chemist direct again in the future, just don't expect your goods quickly.
Put an order in for delivery to UK, waited 10 days on it sitting at pending eventually had to call to find out problem, consequently had to cancel that order and redo it where they took longer than expected to deliver the goods. I would say that the packaging was good as was the picking staff but the customer service team need to contact their customers if there is a problem as it is not good having to wait days and days to find out yourself that your order is not going through!
I have placed a couple of orders with this company. I am from the UK but live in France so getting meds cheaper is important. The site is easy to use and the prices are very competitive and the delivery rate is reasonable. The delivery time though is very poor and on both of my orders it took well over 10working days to reach me. Not good when you are waiting on something.
The outdoor shop always have great prices on good quality outdoor gear. Very easy ordering, and really fast delivery that's generally included in the price. I always look here first if there's something I need.
they are unable to deal with customers speaking English in \France
I've tried using Rebtel for some time to reach my friend from Jamaica from France. 1. I got no free call that worked. 2. After a few months when attempting to add funds I could not login for 2 weeks. 3. The service center sent me 3 different login numbers, none of which worked. 4. I can't recommend them to anyone.
I bought a Clarke Tech 5100 from them and had to return it because recording was not functioning. When they sent it back it was worse & cost me 20 euros p/p. Avoid them they answer emails like parrots.
I was able to find the best price for my tickets.  I was very surprised how easy it was to make the reservation and how quickly the ticket was issued. Site easy to navigate. Many flight options. No hidden costs.  Final price available from the beginning.
facile et rapide bravo a google . merci pour ce service rapide.!!!!
Natural news is full of unbiased information about good nutrition and its obvious relation to good health. I trust this site a lot more than my doctor.
Grandcentral allows you to have a telphone number in the area code of your choice, then redirect it to your actual cell phones numbers. You can then screen incoming phone calls, customize your voicemail to individual callers, have voicemail sent in SMS format...great service for anybody that travel a lot.
I bought some of their products for my mother, she found the packaging nicely designed and she has been happy with the results.
Librivox is the biggest database of audiobooks that are in the public domain (it means there are no copyrights on them) and you can download them for free
I bought tickets for a music festival from Stubhub after all other websites were sold out, I payed them a little bit over the nominal price (expected) but they were sent on time, nothing to complain
I found their products on Amazon and ordered Pre-Workout, Tribulus Terrestris and L-Glutamine. They are cheaper for the same quality than the bigger brands. What I like most is that their advertising is simple and straight to the point, unlike most other companies that will use pseudo-scientific jargon to lure gullible customers. Will make other orders from them without a doubt
Skyscanner can show you some good deals fast, but most of the time you'd better search for yourself on the actual sites of companies to see the whole options you have, especially when you have stopovers
Any e-commerce website using this ridiculous "company" as payment should be avoided. I have an issue with a website that is not refunding money despite the product being out of stock. Skrill claims to offer protection for these kinds of cases, but when contacted, their response was in short "you're too late, sorry". This service should be shut down by the authorities of the respective countries they are present in.
i bought a unlock code for a htc one m7 at 14h15  and at 14h17 my code is already on my e-mail. the price is too much but it's worth to buy . thanks a lot
i bought an unlock code for iphone 5 uk orange after 1 weeks with week end i haven't got my unlock. I want a refund integrally for my buy
date de livraison non respectee et de plus un defaut sur la table livree
Extremely efficient, free shipping from UK to southern France, even for a small order, arrived in a few days (~50€)
I've been using Giganews for years, it worked fine until a few months. Giganews has become very unreliable, most of the posts are incomplete or missing, I am going to close my Diamond account because of that. A big waste of time and money.
The order was quickly send Product order is very good quality Thanks
Toujours pro pour les délais de livraison en un temps record !
I had a room far below the rate of other people, but my room was the same as other people. Definitely a good deal!
Is very expensive present but my mother loves it and make me happy too.
I am very happy with my order. First I found the 2014 calendar I was looking for and couldn't find anywhere else and it was very easy to place the order for it. Then I received it quickly, which was valuable as the year had already started.
j aime beaucoup ce site ou il y a des affaires et ou la livraison est hyper rapide
Thank you for the quick delivery of 'Prascend' tablets for my mare and the 5% discount which was very much appreciated! I would like to order more often from VioVet, for my horse, my donkey ,dogs and cats, but as I live in France,the shipping fare is very expensive,especially for heavy items. Everybody is so friendly and helpful, when I ask a question, I get an answer the same day,I appreciate very much. Thank you very much!
order what ever you want from england through this web site, they are wonderful!
I don't know anything about Orange UK, I use it in France
Write why you found the experience excellent. For instance: The item arrived the day after I ordered it! The customer service was very helpful and I got all the information that I needed. I can only recommend this company to others. Excellent service and fast delivery. I imagine that the late delivery was due to the appalling weather at the time. I needed them for an elderly lady who was celebrating her birthday. However, the she told me that they were beautiful and she was delighted with them. I would certainly use your service again.
Produit conforme a la description et a la photo très content de mon achat
I love american food but I live in France. So thank you american market.
Great watch for a small price. An after sell service really professional. The only problem was DHL, 2 days overdue. I'll certainly buy more watches from CreationWatches.
I ordered a micro SD card 1 month ago with a standard shippement. I was worrying when I saw nothing coming in my mailmox 3 weeks later. I had a great support from their website. 2 days later my SD card arrived.
livraison au petit garage éfficace . bravo encore des + pour ce garage .
My contact Sara was very helpful by planning my flights and she found me the best possible connections to not spend all my vacation on the airports and also managed my visa for Australia ;-) However, the payment itself was a bit difficult as I am not from the UK (Euro versus GBP). Also the communication that just a permit by credit card is required for the booking didn´t reach me (by the substitute of Sara). Therefore, I needed to make twice a bank transfer to pay the final amount of money...
I was a bit worried about some bad reviews i read on other websites than trustpilot. Using the live chat, i asked a lot of questions regarding my order and trying to figure out if i could trust camerakings and spend almost 600€ of dslr gear there. I was in contact with some patient, helpful and commited guy who answered every question he could, and tried to help me chosing the perfect gear i was looking for. Delivery was pretty fast, although some parts where coming from India. Living in France, I had to pay additional costs for tax and custom duty for these parts. Camerakings told me they would cover that, as mentioned in their terms and conditions. The nice part : i had two bills for this, 17€ and 24,90€, and could only give them the 24.90€ bill because i was dumb enough to lose the other one. Nevermind. Talking about trust : they just took my word and refund me the total amount £34,50 GBP although i couldn't provide the second bill. Well, it's the first time i'm happy enough of the service of an online shop to write a review about them, i usually don't, but they definitely deserve it. Camerakings.co.uk is definitely the place to get quality gear for good prices, and i will order there again without any mistrust.
I order from France, shipping quite fast, very nice stuff but... taxes are veryyyyyy expensive!!!! thanks every one
My order arrived the next day which is very good service. the ghd straighteners are absolutely great, warm quickly and make your hair smooth unlike other brands. Definitely the best i have used. b richmond piot
I managed to cancel my car booking within 2 clicks. Thank you and sorry for the trouble it could have created.
excellent rapport qualité prix et livraison rapide. Que demander de plus !
comment ne pas recommander ce site quand tout ce qu'il propose est au top
Very fast to register pay and receive the game. Just as the name advertised!
I like this company because you don't have to go to a drop off point and collect.
super ras tres bon service et toujours a la date prevue
I contacted the support to have more information on the price for the shipping, my coupon code and other important matters. I wanted to order a "Scorpion Knives Lofty Wiseman Survival Tool 11 Inch" and a "Scorpion Knives Lofty Wiseman Survival Tool 8 Inch". I knew that from time to time some manufactory defects were detected.  I wrote an Email which was replied within an hour or so. Olly from the support gave me all the details and info I needed. I ordered them and got the knives in France within 3 days through UPS. The shipping was totally free, the total amount was over  £200. All went well and I highly recommend this great store with all those working for it. They have great prices, people working are wonderful, moreover with my coupon I got -5% discount.... I certainly will reorder ASAP for more items...
Easy web site for the user, plenty of help offreed by the team. This resulted in my delivery getting here in excellent time and at a very good price
Best price I could find on the web and rapidly delivered
I have all received very quickly. I recommend this seller and I will ever buy new.
Although the product ordered was in stock, the expedition took more time than announced.
Command sent the same day and received parcel in France two days later. Items conform to the description, correct prices. I recommend this site.
Did all 3 loops and night tours.Gave me a good idea of NYC. Only drawback is night tour: apart from Times Square and Fifth Ave, there is not much to see and one realises that this is a poorly lit city. I am a big fan of BigBus tours all over the world.
I received very well the expanded edition of JUNIOR "JI" (1982). This is a great album of early 80's R&B!
absolutely poor experience. The price announced is simply not correct, it hides numerous extras saying it is the agency's responsibility. The car given is full of damages to start with (13 scratches identified!) and most of all CarDelMar is neither responsible nor accountable for any of it. AVOID.
Good price and fast delivery what do you expect more
My brain is in full gear to start new projects.
I had tried elsewhere, but without satisfaction till my son searched then came across you company, jackpot!!
Well confident to deal with your company,I recommend to any one seeking help in that field.
Craziness about my demountable picture frames,my prayer has been answered by simply-envelopes,simple as that.
Having only given one day's ordering notice, I was very pleased to have received a big thank you from the recipient, the next day. I haven't viewed the flowers myself, but I understand they were thought to be very lovely. Thank you!
rien a dire piece de qualité et livraison en temps est en heure
on a commander un livre de 100 pages et tout est super bien passé, livré dans les temps
hi, thanks you very much for fhis purchase, no doubt i will reuse it if i need thanks
comment faire confiance quand il n y a pas de respect pour le client
I had booked my tickets on the website with 15% off. A deluxe tour for two days we enjoyed the red and the Green lines and the free pass for the ferry boat It was safe, easy 😀 interesting and we didn't have to wait the buses I warmly recommend this tour to discover HK
It's fantastic to be able to buy all those nice things you can't get here. Prices on certain products are rather high but the postage is really reasonable. Long life !!!
serious site, friendly and communicative cheap (quality / price) I recommend to others
ce site est mon inspiration !!! toujours de super recette, plus besoin de livre !
Ordering was a doddle - relatively fast with no pain.
Found exaclty what I was looking for ..ordered it...received it.  I like that American Market lets you know when they sent off your order, especially since I am in Switzerland.
very serious and professionnal site never fading any disappointment  with business with otel.com you can go confidently
The policy offered by Chubb/Halo is interesting starting 14 days of car rental in one year. Anyone renting cars sometimes should have it!
A long time customer, I am completely satisfied with Cult Pens. The customer service is always there to answer questions.
Pas de probleme de la commande a la reception du materiel
I ordered on Saturday morning and I got a call on the afternoon to organise same day delivery! I would give 6 stars if I could! I strongly recommend this webshop!
There is an extensively variety of useful supplements available on this website, all at the lowest market prices. The quality is as good as what we can expect for such supplements. The delivery is as fast as with most other providers, and shipping fees too. Only thing that could be improved, the packaging of the supplements. Bags are not always so handy. But I guess they're used to reduce the costs and so there's nothing wrong to tell about it.
I have hired cars through Holiday Autos in Nice many times and found them to be an excellent company to do business with and I don’t feel I am going to get unexpected charges as I have done with other companies.  I will certainly use them again.  HOWEVER, they are now using Firefly, which I now always refuse, even if I have to pay extra, as they have all the hallmarks of a cheap operation with dirty older cars and they run the fuel empty to empty, which is always problematic.  National Citer, who I tried again this time as I was travelling alone, score only marginally better and agin I was disappointed with the car that smelt of stale cigarettes, had lost of marks on the bodywork (which they did note on the docs) the driver’s seat back kept dropping backwards and it was a Corsican car that had done 42,000km which is more used than I would normally expect.  My advice is to pay a little extra and go with the bigger suppliers, such as Hertz, but book through Holiday Autos.
Reassuring to know I bought from the manufucaturer and not from a bootleg vitamin supplier.  Prices competitive too this time so if they stay that way I will be back for more
I just got an iPhone and this is pretty much the only app I use regularly on it due to its continuous efficiency and its ability to utterly transform any pictures !
Once again, delivery to France was ok and once again i was perfectly happy with the shoes i received. Thanks.
La marchandise est conforme aux descriptions et la livraison est rapide.
I wanted to buy an HTC One when it's released, so I ask them if they can find one black for me (black one was very hard to find at this time, even not officially available), and they find one very quickly and send it to me. I'll be back by them for a future purchase!
For the price, there is nothing to say. But the big problem with customs in France. In fact, I live in France, I just ordered perfume and I had to pay 24.53 euros customs fees. This is innamissible ... So, this site is not expensive moin and furthermore, it does not warn customers that there are customs fees in addition.
un site d'habits a la mode pour tout les gouts et choix super franchement BRAVO
Very prompt delivery and easy to use website. Will certainly be reordering
I'm very satisfied with your products and the serious of your company. Delivery is quick and secure to arrive in France (I'm French). Bravo et merci !
Had some trouble changing a phone operator in France, and I was seriously doubting that the iphone I had was locked. I used the carrier check, and it revealed it was unlocked already. Rapid and clear response from the staff, that sent me searching for another reason which I solved eventually. So a honest deal with professional guys, I highly recommend JM unlock for those looking to unlock their phones. With the multitude of scam sites on the net proposing to unlock phones, trustworthy people are indeed rare and hats off to JM unlock!
It was a great evening. Food was yummy. Wine was tasty. Sightseeing on a fabulous sunny day was a one in a lifetime experience - that you can of course renew anytime!
Very quick the second time I used it. The transfer speed was clearly beyond my expectations.
a bit long for delivery but very happy with the items and very well posted by gofsupport about when to be delivered thank you
So i bought on the 30th of june two cardigans, i wait for two weeks and still no news about my order. I decide to send a mail to know where was my items. They said that on of the items were out of stock. First bad point : if the items were out of stock, why did they still sell them as "in stock" and why did they waited a mail from me to warning me ? Then they told me both items were out of stock... Then they ask me if i would exchange against another product from the website... Of course i said no, because if i would want to buy something else i would do so in the first place, so i ask a total refund. And by miracle one of the item was sent... Then i ask for the refund or a date for the shipment of the other, and they told me that both of the item were already sent on 04/09/13... Which is quite impossible cause i made my order on 06/30/13... I think they are pretty f***ing kidding me. That's why i'm so angry with them. So even if they really do send me my items, this way of treating people is unacceptable... So today I have NO IDEA of what they sent me, both of the item, only one item. OR WORSE another item i never ask for ?!
The UK version, is like the FR version. They are both great, with good product. But you can trust this website with closes eyes. When I don't find a product in the FR version I directly looking into the UK version for the product. It's a great subtitute for us french buyers.
The US version, is like the FR version. They are both great, with good product. The only thing i could blame them is that not all of the product can be ship to France. I guess it's normal. But you can trust this website with closes eyes.
Nice price, nice service. What else ? They work with all the hiring compagnies. Sometimes you can find cheaper but you have to search a lot in the internet for that.
one thing could be improved, the espace for the legs.
All perfect, the shoes are fantastic and the the shipment arrived despite the snow!
Easy to order, arrived when it said it would. Was only disappointed the mince pies and the baps were out of stock!!!
The top have a fault, I will have to pay pay (a lot) for an alteration because the top was in sold and now out of stock so I can not return it for a change... The clothes should be checked before shipping!
Excellent but attention for importation in Switzerland Post Tax is basis CHF 18.00 plus 3% of imported value and VAT 8%!!!
3rd time that I order on this website, just perfect.
Went on a three luxury holidays with this company and it was very very expensive, mainly due to our high budget we had but it was worth every single penny. I highly recommend Luxury retreats. The before after, during and after customer service was also fantastic. We will be back soon!
This company used my Visa card to go to Spain, from London Stansted Airport with Ryan air and other cosmetics etc. How do I know they used my card? Because I payed using Visa over the phone. I had problems with service  but I was offered a full refund if I removed my negative comment on their ebay shop. I accepted this gesture they refunded me but months later the same visa card was used to book flight tickets to Madrid, they also have a shop in Spain too. Keep in mind that I only used my visa card for online payments and it was a new card and I do not use the visa card for anything else as I have other cards for travel etc. which are kept separate and no other company or person knew my card number. I have reported them to the police and another UK crime unit. Since then they are no longer selling via ebay and have received too many negative feedback.
No different to backstreet abortion clinics- Glad that the gov will soon be looking into this. I will be proving my point that this company has FAKE REVIEWS with web analytics Obey and go and report this review you total GLORY HOLE Update. Yes  would be happy for a refund but are there any conditions like time limits as it as been  many years and I want to be 100% that you will not retract your offer for a refund. Anyways you will be able to find my on your system that's if you keep a record of all your clients. If you can't do a name and address search over a period of time or have any other conditions or some kind of catch then it will not be worth it, esp from your previous replies. Also I did also mention previously that your eye surgeon was laughing at me with his nurses. They were in total hysterics. They knew I understood that the joke was about me and went away before coming back to do my eye op. Just image how you would feel.  If you can understand makes me more angry than the constant need for eye drops for my very dry eye. I only had one eye done with LASIK at your Finchley Road, London branch. I am not in the UK.
I only had one eye done with these wonderful people and service at Moorfields eye hospital done on privately. MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE HIGH STREET CHICKEN FACTORY STYLE CLINICS.  I highly recommend Moorfields eye hospital, after all they are well established. If you want to go elsewhere like _____ I won't mention there name because they hate negative press and will report my honest review just because they can't accept it. Anyways do your RESEARCH FULLY BEFORE going to any high street clinics that will leave you will dry crusty eyes. ;P
They never seem to have my perfume in stock. They always have promos but when you work out the price it is not much of a discount. So I never really bother with them I just buy when I need to.
This bank will sell you their dead grandmother. They will try and put fear into you to take out insurance you do not need. e.g My home is already insured but they still want me to take out insurance with them and have all kinds of protection. Then when you say not they will try and sell you something else. It's non-stop. They are also not up to date with modern bank technology. You can't even make a simple transfer without having to go into  your branch or sending a fax to get it signed off. This bank used to be good but they have gone down the drain. My bank advisor was even talking about me and shaking her head at reception, thinking that I could not see her. I am just waiting until I move town before I write them a letter telling them adieu.
The clothes are nothing special, just average. However the Manageress at Victor Hugo, Grenoble, France is a nightmare. I don't know if she still works there but she is small build and has blond her and acts as if she is the queen. The Manageress will serve other customers behind you in the que first then walk off and let one of her other staff serve you and push your clothes to one side like you are a piece of rubbish. Keeping in mind that she is working in Zara not Hermes or Christian Dior. This has not only happened to me but I have seen that she is the same way with everyone else unless she knows them personally. This woman is so bad that I had to report her to HQ in Paris. HQ was aware of this Manageress as this was not news to them. The good thing is that HQ did not cover it up and find some excuse that it was all a misunderstanding.

Sign up was easy, CS was OK but I did have a very rude woman called Sara Stayrook  (this woman should be sacked) who I reported but the other staff are very good. Now all I am waiting on is to build my own website and start selling my own goods.
If you are a small or large business use 2checkout instead. No need for me to tell you all the paypal nightmare stories
I had some good FAKE items from ioffer but if you have a problem e.g seller does not ship, gives you a fake tracking number or missing damaged goods, all ioffer will do is tell you to contact paypal that's if ioffer responds to your message. ioffer know that all Dr. Dre Beat headphones, Hermes and Gucci bags are fake. You must know that too right? So if you want to take a risk it is up to you. This is the only way ioffer is can make money so they will just turn a blind eye and continue. This is still dodgy dealings from ioffers side of view and will never have any other direct payment apart from paypal who are another story. They get there cut too!
If you want to look like Mutton Dressed As Lamb, then Ann Summers is the place for you. The VERY POOR QUALITY clothes are very OVER PRICED and the customer service is very bad.  You can find almost identical products on a known Chinese website for 1/8 of the price plus free delivery worldwide. I first thought all the staff were really nice and helpful etc. UNTIL I had a problem. I was made to feel like I was a liar, however I had all the proof that I was within my rights. I suggest people AVOID this company unless you want to receive a rude after service when you have problems with your items.
FreePeople will not like the fact that I am writing this review. However I have the right to Free Speech. I received a tax bill  and my item looked nothing like what I had ordered. The customer service is RUBBISH to say the least. The items are OVER PRICED for the quality you receive. I was silly enough to buy from them again and they lost my order along with other customers orders. AVOID this company. >>>> If this review gets reported again please be sure I will make a video about my full experience. I will not be muted. <<<<<
They failed to deliver on time. When I called them the woman was so rude it was a joke. There call centre for France is based in Morocco but the woman with a very strong Eastern European accent was very unprofessional. It was like she did not want to work and hated her job. I reported her and she is also know by her other staff to be the same also. So it was not me. She kept me on the phone for over 40 minutes only to tell me nothing much apart from I will receive my letter the same day. This was not true. I also made it known on twitter because of my high phone bill due to Fedex keeping me on hold just for fun. I did get a reply from Emily in the US who told me that she would sort it all out for me but when the French director got in contact with me he never offered any compensation whatsoever. This is not the first time I had nightmare problems with Fedex so now I use UPS and if I have something shipped I always tell the company not to use Fedex. DHL are just as bad too!
I have been using Paks for over 27 years and even when I left the UK and lived in many other countries I still use Paks because they always have what I want, even if they don't have what you want in stock they will call you and with another product suggestion. The prices are OK and much better than my local over priced shops who double charge. This is why I order from Paks because even if I pay for shipping it still works out cheaper for me. OK, OK these days the large supermarket do have some of the same products but Paks ships out so fast it all is worth it for me. Thank you from a loyal customer.
I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE Figleaves back in the day BUT they are not as good as they used to be when they first started off. The customer service has gone right down the drain.  I had problems with my order and they never believed me. My bank alerted me that they tried to debt my visa card twice for an item I never received. When I contacted Figleaves to find out what was going on they, just told me that they made an error.  This was not true because the payment that they done was done manually days after and not automatic. I will never save my card details on their system ever again. So I now shop at BraStop even if they have less choice, I have a much better service before and after sales.
I love this shop because they nice items at nice prices. The customer service is very happy and helpful, not like companies like Figleaves. The only thing is they seem to go out of stock quickly so if there is anything you want just grab it and checkout. They ALWAYS have promo's too! :D Thank you BraStop and keep up the good CS
Parcel arrived with Christmas inside - Luxury Xmas Puds from the British corner shop. Just couldn't do Christmas without them. Speedy postal service winged the goods our way in time for Santa.
i have always the best cost and the best hostel because your website is realy the best of the best
I ordered my machine at 6.15pm on Thursday and it arrived in rural South of France at 11.00am on Tuesday morning, which I thought was pretty amazing.  Lots of lovely goodies in the box, too - I shan't have to buy any thread ever!  Even a European mains adaptor included, which was very thoughtful.  Very happy indeed and now no excuses for lack of creativity.  I would certainly recommend SMD.  Very many thanks.
I bought a CD Key for the Sims 3 - University add-on and got it in 15 minutes. It worked well and I had no problems to register the key and download the game on Origin. I got the add-on half the original price and even if the game is nice, it doesn't worth much! So really a great deal and i'm very happy of the efficiency of this site! :)
Over the last three years I have used Albelli eight times - to produce six large photo books and two calendars. Each time I have been delighted with the results. Before using Albelli the first time, I shopped around, asked friends and compared results achieved by others using different on-line services. In the end, I found the downloadable tool provided by Albelli for creating the desired style, layout, format, etc., superior to others and easier to use, and it is this that attracted me to the service. The reasons for remaining a loyal customer are the outstanding quality of the resulting product, the speed of production, the on-line version of the photo book available within hours of uploading the content, and the overall professionalism of the organisation. I should add that, although I was very pleased with the first photo book produced, it has been good to see that Albelli are constantly making small improvements to the service, such as lay-flat pages and double-page photos, so that each time i seem to get an even better, higher quality, more professional result. I would recommend Albelli without hesitation.
C'est toujours important d'evaluez les sites comme ca un tri est fait entre les sites serieux et les sites incompetent
But this time there were a problem with a Jeans (a mistake from Boohoo) so I wait and see if my Jeans will be resend me... If yes, I could say Boohoo is really perfect because even if they made a mistake, they repair it perfectly ! All people that answer me by email were really king and professionnal !
My first purchase here and I was a little nervous.  However within 24 hours I got an e-mail  "Your order is ready for delivery tomorrow".  I wasn't available.  The delivery company were so enthusiastic about finding a suitable alternative delivery time that I was left feeling "Do not hide.  We WILL deliver this !"  The article was well packaged and as described.  A first class combination of supplier and carrier.
My opinion of Wood Finishes Direct moved from first class to excellent after they chased me 1/2 way around Europe to correct a delivery failure by their transporter.  I've just completed another order with them and their service was such that I've now run out of superlatives !
Hi ! So I've ordered a beautiful dress from Boohoo and it"s very gorgeous ! Good quality and all. I love that the devilery is free (especially for international order) but it took a little bit longer than what's declared on the FAQ of the website, and I see that I was not the only one to think that, so I was a little bit stressed but it's really ok now. It wil just be good to add a few days on the devilery estimation on the website. But the custumer services is REALLY GOOD !!! I've really appreciated it ! Thanks for your clothes !^^
We couldn't decide between two excellent carpets, but Daniel's speedy replies helped us to make the right choice.  We placed our order on Sunday evening and it arrived in Provence (a tiny, remote village) by lunchtime on Friday.  Brilliant service and a lovely carpet - and we'll certainly use them again.

Verry efficient hammer drill. the delivery is impressively fast (I am in south of France) I ordered by Sunday, and get the packet by next wednesday. The prize is competitive, even adding transportation fees and plug converter for european wall plug. Great job guys
You can trust Vertigo Interiors. They are Charles Eames products specialist. You may find wider offers on other web site  but here, they have products in stock (otherwise they inform you of the delay) and you can receive them in the same week you have sent your order. And the products are as good as they seem on the pictures.
The brands and products selection is nicely done (if somewhat "so british" from a french customer point of view) and customer care is ever present in case of problem Deserve at least a visit and to my opinion to suscribe to the daily newsletter to keep an eye on the latest offer
impossible d'émettre un avis n é g a t i f
tout est impeccable sauf délai de livraison un peu long par rapport aux concurrents !!
They charged me of 240€ on my CB one month after the end of my contract. I had to pay the car repairs but the car was in very good condition at the end of my contract ! Be careful, they are swindler !!
This shop is quite honest : you get basic products at low price. You know what you get and you can rely on the service.
Prices look amazing, but on my first order (quickly shipped and processed), I received the wrong product (good reference, good size but wrong color). It was supposed to be still available however, so I ordered it a second time, while returning the wrong one (I was refunded for this one). Then after having waited three times longer than the first time, the item was declared unavailable and I've been refunded (always using PayPal). A big joke in fact !
Suntekstore has got a huge quantity of nice items. They do fast delivery and their customer service is very helpfull.
I have just discovered TransferWise, and i think it's very easy to use and very secure to transfer money to my daughter who is studying in England.
Well, in a few words, I would say that GMG sells tons of various games at cheaper prices than any other dealer. So, why paying to much for the same content?
I first bought samples, because, the excellent idea of Paula's Choice is to sell samples so that you can try the products before buying the full size... And I just could not believe that I got such a result OVERNIGHT !!! Of course I immediately wanted to purchase this product ! I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my combination acne prone skin with enlarged pores in the center of the face never looked better since I cannot even remember when. Not a single breakouts, and fantastically reduced pores. So happy !
top ! rien a dire service rapide et complet , service de livraison sans problemé pas comme chez certain concurrent .
I received my shoes within three days and they always answered any questions I had quickly.
I was looking on the internet found this company randomly. I called and to Michelle who made me feel it was a serious business. I had my son birth certificate translated so quick. I was thrilled, I highly recommend it.
I bought a 2 To external hard disk. The service was perfect, I received 2 or 3 email to inform me about my purchase. It arrived very quickly. No problem at all. Simply perfect !
I would try cool blades they are a good service and plenty of choice as well
Have ordered twice now with no complications and really quick delivery. All I've tried have been up to my hopes and I'm glad I tested this site. Janbrosq
Very very good and sure website good and original product, fast excellent i recommand +++++ thank you
Thanks for picking up Milo's skates, mending them and posting them back all within a few weeks. You made a 7 year old happy.
easy to choice easy to buy easy to receipt two days later
The shirt is well made, very large choice of cotton. I find that the (regular) collar is too big compare to others shirtmaker (turnbull & asser for example). Will give 5 stars if more choice for the formal collars. About 3 weeks for the delay.
Very good price, very fast shipping and delivery ! Perfect !
I ordered a new product. They shipped a used product which was not complete. The outer package was in excellent condition but the inner product package was open (!), old, dirty, used and obviously opened / closed several times. The product looks like being used for weeks or longer. So somebody packed someting used and dirty carelessly into a box and shipped it to me. They asked me to send photos. I did. Then they asked me to return the product to them, but at my shipping expense! It was not me who shipped this garbage, but I should care to send it back and to pay for its shipping? Otherwise I would not get my money back. No word of excuse, of course. No process to control the quality of what they ship. Now they say it was "La Poste". They made an inquiry and I need to wait week until I will get a result. If La Poste agrees that they made a mistake, and only then, I might get my shipping expense refunded. It's just a cheap trick to avoid paying. Why do I say this? La Poste handled that product during 2 days of shipping time. There is no way that somebody can make a product looking so much used and dusty in 2 days only. So do not expect any client orientation or client thinking from this company. They live on a planet where there are only stupid clients, happy to accept every and each of their crazy ideas. Better pay more for the same product in a different shop.
Hello, The flower arrived in time and have been appreciate. Next time I'll use again your service to send flowers in England, and the price wasn't so bad. Thank you very much.
Glad to have signed up, use on-line can be frustrating but in the end results are good.
Ordered the product from this UK company but live in France.   Unfortunately my payment was not accepted and, despite having corresponded previously, no contact was made to advise me of the problem with a foreign bank account.   It was only when I checked and chased the matter was I told of this.   I then had to pay an additional sum to get express delivery so that the order could be dispatched and received in time to be brought over to my address in France by friends from the UK.
I am a french customer, and this website has not dissapointed me, you can make good deal every day.
Le site est simple d'utilisation et la livraison est super rapide!!
So good to find products of quality, bring relief and not cost the earth!
I had to cancel several orders, due to non shipments because of stock availability, when the items were advertised in stock ! Last order 2 items out of 4 in the same scheme, shipment expected 5 more days than acknowledged on p.o. ! Will buy from other suppliers, there are a few very reliables !!
Every single order has missing and discontinued items, when shown on stock on the pages of the site! Last order wrong gloves were shipped ! Will buy elswhere for sure
Authentic carpets at affordable competitive prices.   Good quality images on the website and individual flaws clearly described and photographed. Fast delivery and helpful customer service.
We found on the Web a car rental that was much cheaper than the others because it uses old cars. As having a brand-new car doesn't mater for us, we immediately choosed Faircar. It was a bit more complicated as Faircar is not located at the airport, but we managed by having the meeting point at the bus station, which is quite central in Reykjavik. We were a bit desappointed having to pay expensive extra fees for the delivery of the car at this bus station, but at the end, it was still an interesting deal.
Un site convivial et pratique pour éditer de superbes moments !
Un des sous pull est troue et les relations avec la clientèle est mediocre
je recommande ce site , article parfait et livraison dans les temps tout est parfait  , bravo
Produit arrives en temps et en heure .quoi dire sinon mon vif encouragement a commander chez cycles tyres
HiFX offers a simple foreign exchange process although it inevitably requires more steps (or keystrokes) than just using your Bank. With multiple transfer options and alerts coupled with the ability to select recipients, the process is simple. I use it for bank to bank transfers; my bigggest concern is that the funds are instantly taken from the sending bank but (as on this last occasion) it takes 4 days to complete the transaction because HiFX is not available for transactions over the weekend. While there are no service fees, the exchange rate is not stellar either! But it is easy to use and offers reasonable value.
I think that there are some problems with the quality control. I had a metal splinter in finger when I used the bracket first...Result, go to my company infirmary. The sharpening guide has a convex side, so sharpening is not perfect. Sorry for my english, I'm french. PERFECT after-sales service
I have a lot of orders on yesasia, despite some delay, all my order arrived on time, sometime ahead. And the free shipping methods is really great :)
I have been using it for many years and am happy about anything
Anything is there and the system is easy to understand
I had a few questions in regard to a booking I made. A lovely and very patient Rachel communicated with me via e-mail and offered many solutions. She was of great help which I really appreciated.
It was fun to see a website that I never had seen before. The articles were fresh, very stilish, young and not pricy at all. I put a few items in my cart and continued shopping. Nice sweatters, leggings, an other sweater, a really pretty winter dress... I payed my items and received a friendly mail my items would be shipped overseas a day later. As so far, every thing was o.k.. Now it was waiting on that fluffy thick sweater and all the other stuff.I ordered. When my items arrived, wel packed, and on time, I tried them on, the one after the other and I regretted I didn't buy some more cloths at Booho's. All the sweaters looked exactly as on the picture and that's so important when one shops on the Internet. Every item fits as I hope it would fit. I'm very glad to have shopped at Boohoo's and I hope other people will have the same and nice shopping experience I've had. I have so many compliments when I wear the thick fluffy jumper because no one has the same! Yoohoo for Boohoo!
I try to cancel 3 min after a purchase No answer to my 3 emails 0 contact with and you send it anyway apparently and it's just inacceptable...
I ordered flowers and paid online, and they were delivered four hours later in Chudeigh. My sister said they were lovely.
The on-line buying was simple and the customer service the best! Thank you Basika.
A wonderfull roses bouquet, my gf was really touched, thanks a lot Interflora, as alaways you guys rock !
Customer service decided to remove all my reward points from my account because of the quantity I was buying. Customer service is rude and unhelpful, stay away from thegamecollection.
So I ordered a few days ago, got my things delivered in time which is good but my power supply was faulty and it is on me to pay postage for a replacement (16 pounds because tomorrow is a Saturday) and it is on me to drive to a UPS access point because I've got nothing better to do... Offering free shipping is the least you could have done. -- Edit: Customer service contacted me and refunded cost for the delivery of the second PSU, that's appreciated.
Been a seller (2000 sales) and buyer for about two years, paid over 5000 quid of commissions and they blocked my account, it's impossible to find out why, they don't read their emails, customer service has virtually no power to do anything about anything. It's too bad because sellers on ebay are actully great but they gotta suffer because they simply can't hire people who are competent enough to answer an email. Congrats ebay, you lose yet another customer to amazon
Amazing at what passes for customer service these days, call centers in India where people barely understand you, keep no track of your previous phone calls and read through scripts even after calling for the seventh time. Go with any other cheaper broadband companies, at least you're expecting their customer service to be terrible.
Still holding my money for an order they cancelled even though they were still showing stock on the website. no response from customer service. avoid.
Sure, pretty good prices but the day you have an issue with your order, you might as well forget about your money. Customer service is inexistent, they don't care for their customers. My advice, spend an extra couple of quids and buy from Amazon, at least the customer service answers your emails.
The delivery was quick, the product was well protected for transport, which is important for a valve guitar amplifier. Only thing is that you doin't get a full invoice to keep for warranty, just a heat paper ticket that will probably fade away quickly.
What to add to previous comments? Nothing except....more....more than perfect. Packaging : Excellent. Delivery time : Nice. Contact & relationship : more than more than perfect, like me even Sunday noon!!!!! My final comment : You are perfect example of successful commercial business illustrated by your customer service. Be sure that you'll stay my exclusive perfume supplier as far as you maintain your philosophy. Philippe from Lyon France.
beaucoup de pub pour pas grand chose y a cas aller sur les forums de ce site et voir les gens mécontants
We've just renewed the handle on our ancient Bosch dishwasher with an eSpares part and it is now better than the original: It opens far easier with less effort. Postage was fast (we're in France) and I can't fault anything about the buying process or the part provided.
I bought from them an hdmi - dvi cable through Amazon Marketplace. My order took more than 2 weeks to arrive but it did not disturbed me because I intended to use this cable to connect my PC to my TV and I was not in a hurry. Unfortunately when I wanted to connect the cable to my TV (more than 30 days after receiving it) I put the hdmi end of the cable into an hdmi port that was not the right one. I have a Samsung TV with several hdmi port and there is one specific to use for an Hdmi / Dvi connexion to work. I then tried to pull it out smoothly and it broke. The metalic casing of the hdmi end of the cable just broke free. In more than 30 years of computer handling, I had never seen a cable breaking like this (without real reason) but I told myself kenable was not the manufacturer so they were not really guilty. I contacted them to inform them of my problem and to tell them that I was ready to buy another cable but that I feared the same problem could arise (I just needed to be reassured, and to feel that these people were serious). They asked me for pictures of the cable, then for a picture of the connexion I plugged the cable into. I quickly provided them with the pictures. They then asked me if I had put the cable into an USB socket instead of an hdmi socket. The tech from Kenable even told me : "I have worked here six years and never had an end fall of the HDMI cable so can not believe that it wasn't forced". Well that was a point I had to agree with him ; I had never seen an end falling like this from an hdmi cable. However using computers since the 1980's (when their tech must have been in diapers) I still can recognize an USB socket from an hdmi one and I know how to correctly unplug a cable from a socket. After I told them I had made no mistake, they asked me to send back the cable. Unfortunately the cable was worth about 11 euro, and the cost of a return from France was about 15 euro. Had their tech admitted that there was a small chance that the cable was defective, I still would have send it for them to examine it. However, as it was clear the tech did believe I had broke the cable, I did not trust them to be fair and refused to sent it back. I told them so and explained why. They just replied "Thank you for your feedback."... So I just lost 11 euro because a stupid tech does not admit that a cable can be defective. With Kenable the prices are low, but so is the quality of some of their products and the quality of their customers service. P.S. : Kenable has just tried to have this review deleted by saying to Trustpilot  that I did not have any proof of purchase. I emailed my Amazon invoice to Trustpilot so they can see who is telling the truth... It seems Kenable do not like reviews if they are not positive.
Disappointed that we won't be able to buy few brands of american food soon, I've ordered some M&M's packs to discover different flavours that we'll never have the chance to buy here in France. High satisfaction for my choices, they were great. Moreover, the delivery was perfect: in good condition, fast. Very happy of my order on that website.
I'm really happy about yours services. It's easy to order even France. My order arrive quickly without problem. Your after sales service is very competent and serious. I order on your website eyes closed. Thanks very much
The items are unique, stylish and affordable. I only waited a few days to get delivered - like it is said on the website. Each piece of jewellery was displayed in lovely little boxes. You get answered to your comments on the Facebook page. All those little things make Trashy Art a reliable and fashionable company.
rien a dire .rapidite de livraison emballage soigne tout est ok
attention de ne pas liver au heure de sortie de classe
Hostelbookers is obviously the best hostels reservation service: easy, very good prices option overall, lots of comments and indication to make a good choice, clear and fast confirmations after the booking. Aeas of improvement: -Better care for customers loyalty. Ive booked probably more than 20 times this year and I have no advantages at all, not even a login so that I dont have to rewrite all my details each time. -Easier comparison between the hostels- we always have to go back several pages..takes too much time -Make 100%sure the confirmation is ok for the hostel too- it is rare but some hostels already cancelled me the reservation confirmed by hostelbookers and it is really annoying -Give a more precise indication on internet : almost everybody says they have, but it is very important for me and I need more information : is it wi-fi? is it free? does the connection work in private rooms? But overall Ive been travelling for 1 year now and I am keen on hostelbookers service and choice ! AMELIE BARRE
Transfer tool much longer than first time, and there was some complication about me having supposedly set restrictive transfer paramaters, which I had absolutely no memory of doing (and this did not come up at all the first time around). Will give them a third and last chance though.
everything went the way it should be: fast and reliable. Thanks and congratulations for the grate service!!
A pleasure to buy in your store! Thanks a lot! Oscar
impeccable livraison hyper rapide et marchandise idem a la description
Boohoo is a website which proposes clothes always fashionable and inspired by the current trends. The prices are affordables and the customer service is more than completes. I recommend this site in all those who want to be dressed-well all year long!
I have been looking for designers chairs for a while, but those I found were either way out of my budget or from shady online shops. Then I found Bluesuntree, I found the seats I ve been looking for (Jacobsen swan and saarinen). Delivery was really fast, ordered on oct 5th received 3 weeks later although the items were out of stock and planned within 10 weeks... They were deliverd by express delivery at my place. Quality is good considering the price, quality fabric and construction. I would definitely buy again from them.
Having ordered. I was really surprised at how quickly the items arrived here in France. Good value fro money, and the 3 for 2 offer too good to miss! You can rely on Vitabiotics to deliver the goods!
Incredibly pleased with the light fitting, received within 3 days. Lovely quality. The false start was because Litecraft information required a County field to be entered in the details, which unfortunately does not appear on the bank holder details. Thus we lost a couple of days whilst this was sorted but thanks to a lovely helpful girl, everything was sorted by 'phone, and the product dispatched. Will definitely use Litecraft again!
better prices with the special discount, good range of products
a donner en exemple pour d"autre site encore bravo et merci
I already ordered several times from Lookfantastic , I 'm really satisfied with their products. I ordered two straighteners GHD, their price is very attractive and the highest quality , I also order cappilaire product of high quality. More I live in France , I did not have any shipping charges and the products were home quickly. I really recommend this site !

The big tour on Downtour is long and permit a large discover of the city. Recommanded !
LOPA Removals from the very beginning have been absolutely fantastic in providing first class customer service. They were always on hand to answer any queries we had and were extremely prompt and efficient in resolving any questions we had about our complicated move from France to the UK. They were meticulous in the removal and delivery process, turned up exactly at the time arranged, and also delivered all our items exactly when they said they would. Not only that they took time and care to ensure that they placed the items exactly where we asked them to, nothing was to much trouble. I can't rate them any higher, A+++++ service, thank you all so much at LOPA for making the transition as easy and cost efficient as possible.
Very satisfied with Riverside Garden Centre. The product was despatched quickly and delivered next day, in good condition and included the additional items included as partof the deal (cleaning brush, cover and gas bottles). What more could you as for?
The parts exactly match the original and delivery rooms are exceptionally short. We are very well informed about the status of the order and delivery.
site à ne pas rater pour nos envies de chaussures
I was pleased to find what I wanted with e-spares and at the best price. Living outside UK,  I was amazed how reasonable the postage was and how quickly the part arrived.
Super company.  Made a big effort to keep me informed about delivery. The service felt really personal - something rare in this technological society.  You know you are dealing with human beings and not a computer.
This ia a good, fast and straight forward website. The only thing you can not apply discount code you may have a receive by email - which in this case prevent you unfortunately to use their website.
i m very glad to make a order in your company i recommanded your compagny at my friend thank a lot for your job continue like this have a good day
I recommand this website very much because there are many  beautifulclothes, shoes etc... And it's very quick !

After losing my hair twice from chemptherapy treatment I am delighted to find quality items that work on fine hair. Good hair days really make a difference to how you feel and I am very happy to support a business that has helped me to feel better.
MedicAnimal continue to provide outstanding service and quality products. Explanations and descriptions are always well researched.The price is excellent and attention to detail supports a caring customer service. I have recommended this company in the past and will continue to do so. Great range of well known brands, quick delivery, excellent price.
I am a current client of this website, i ordrer for france. The prices are really really good, moreover there is some good brands the big problem is the ship, my 3 last orders arrived in an open carton :( i order on a lot , lot , lot of websites, and it's the only one which is so bad for protection of the products
We booked online to get a discount for one day city tour bus of dubai, where we spent 5 nights so we wanted to get a quick overview from day one of the possibility offered by the city. We were 2 adults and 3 kids, so for the whole family it costs us 137usd, think about it before ! we had to take a taxi from our  hotel to the first departure in Deira city not to miss the bus, because in effect sometimes there are no signs of the bus station for pick up. We have done the full tour on and off, and the cruise also, but didn't manage to catch the boat taxi, though it is quite exhausting with the kids when you have to wait for the bus or the cruise under the sun... The lady who took our ticket really insisted to give a discount on a two days bus tour, but we refused. if you think about it it is worth it, because in effect the next day we went to Atlantis with taxi and metro and it was not cheap at all ! so more or less the same price with the bus, the thing is we wanted to spend the full day in atlantis so what's the point of paying for the city tour bus ? So for us no regret at all we had what we wanted, a good start to discover the city !
Lots of item in and references in stock, perfect descriptions to avoid surprises... Shipping very fast even abroad, I ordered from France close to Paris, my order reach me with a local delay below 5 days...
Transair is my number one pilot shop. not only do they stock all the products that I've ever considered buying, they deliver really quickly and reliably!

I am very happy with the quality of the furnitures. The furnitures are beautiful - perfect. Very satisfied as the reception and communication with the company. Very reactive and symathiques, very professional. I live in France and the delivery was also perfect. Thank you very much."
Ordered several team kits from All4cycling and always received perfect quality cycling wear and the orders have been quickly shipped to France.
I recommend the prophet tour irons as o very good blade set.
a bit expensive - but boy was it fast.  everything fragile was well packed and arrived nicely -there were a few candy bars that got broken....
Ebookers works far better than most other travel search programs.  Advice is clearly listed and efficient in communication.  Don't have to search for comparisons and extra info, its all clearly shown, and it works real fast, which makes it a pleasure to use. Have dropped the competitors because I don't like wasting time.
every time i install a program my default search engine changes. why don't you make a default option in firefox - never to change the default search engine if you don't enter your password.
When paying with paypal, there is no option to see the amount payed in the paypal authentication page ! This SUCKS ! In addition, I was charged in pounds £ whereas I was displaying prices in euros € !
During an EU express service my small parcel has been destroyed, then lost (no tracking available) so hasn't been delivered at the right date. After a few insistant calls in UK and in France the package has been found and delivered after one day of delay. This company didn't get me the right service, they refused to refund me and they never called me back for explanations. I anyway managed to find out that my little 1 kg package has been mixed and manipulated with heavy pallets in the plane! I know that it is a one-off bad experience of life and everybody make mistakes but I won't risk again with interparcel.
Great first experience with Fragrance Direct! Received the package 1 week after the purchase even though the web site told it to be more like 20 dans. One problème though. It was the delivery updaye status that didn't work, the code to follow the package was't recognize by the shopping service.
Distinctive Chesterfields offers a great choice and brilliant quality. Customizable from start to finish, the chesterfield you get can be exactly as you dreamt about it! The customer care is exceptional, with a remarquable availability, especially from the lovely Lauren, in charge of the social media services. Although a little confusion during the delivery part, my order arrived safe and sound in my living room, in time for Christmas, as intentionally ordered. The result is worth the wait. I will certainly recommend and might even order again soon enough!
the products are goods but think that you will have to get an adaptator for the plug
If you ever shall upgrade your memory I can recommend Mr Memory
bonnes idées de cadeaux pour tous les geeks ! original !
Fast service, and how awsome to finally get these cool candies we usually only see in the movies! Will use very often
livraison serieuse, le sac de transport est parfait pour mon jack russel et de bonne qualité grace a son armature métallique
I've been dealing with Interior Icons for two years now. Our whole office space in France is equipped with their furniture and we keep buying. Everybody visiting our office adores the furniture. Interior Icons has a great choice of products, very good prices, very good quality. I compared a lot before ordering the first time and Interior Icons always beats the competition either by quality or by price or both. Customer Care is the most friendly and professional I have so far experienced in my life and I’m buying stuff online since 1994. I’ve never felt more comfortable with an online shop. They even beat Amazon by far because there’s always a personal touch to every mail that is exchanged and they are faster too. If I could give 10  stars, I would!
I ordered a Doogee phone. I received it within reasonable time. It didn't work (burned micro)., but the battery didn't last more than half a day on standby. So I send the item back. Cost me €25. After that it was impossible to communicate with them. They kept changing the answers and the persons. First they gave me the option for repair or refund. I want refund or the same model but a working phone (new). They said ok, only would pay price diference if it exists. And now they ask me more 50% of the phone price. It is very frustrating trying to communicate with them. The don't keep promises. They have no sense of quality responsibility. Wish I had Never spent money with TinyDeal.
I just regret that the franchise is so high... which encourage me to pay an extra-insurance for it.
The NY passes were very usefull in a lot of ways. Not only you can avoid the long waitingtimes, it also gives you a better impression of what the city has to offer you. not only the handy guide, also the map is utile! It costs a bit but if you have to pay all the entrees, it will cost you more then double...
I made 2 command here, I was very satified I a french customer excuse my english ;)
perfect ! I bought a digital pan card and I could use it within 10minutes...
I ordered 2 Nikwax products from France and wanted them to be shipped to my daughter's place in London. - JUST AFTER MY ORDER ON-LINE: impossible to access my account. I emailed them about that. No answer. - 3 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: I received an email confirming my order. I phoned them to tell my account was not reachable and to make sure the products would be arriving before 3 days. The person on the phone told me my order was about to be shipped and would be delivered in time before the end of the week. - ABOUT 9 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: nothing was arrived, still not possible to access my account. My wife called twice. She has been told they had computer problems and would call us back. No one did. - ABOUT 11 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: still nothing arrived, no access to my account. I called once again. Told me the products would be shipped soon. - ABOUT 18 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: no products delivered, no access to my account. New phone call. They told me my order had not been delivered because my daughter was not at home when the postman came. So the parcel was going to be returned back to them and shipped again to her, as she did not pick it up at the Post Office. They gave me a tracking number stating the parcel was going back. My daughter told me she never saw any postman or card left from him. - ABOUT 33 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: still nothing delivered, still no access to my account. As I was quite a little tired of phoning, I emailed them. Where is my order? Why can't I access my account? Why do they never answer my emails? Is it possible to be refunded? They emailed me back, the first communication from them (with the email of order confirmation). What did they say to me? My parcel had just be returned to them and would be shipped again to my daughter, as she was not at home when... - EXACTLY 40 DAYS AFTER THE ORDER: PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO MY DAUGHTER BUT WITH A WRONG NUMBER OF STREET. NOTHING MORE TO SAY...
I ordered a parka from France and had it delivered in London at my daughter's place. Everything has been fine. Thank you so much, I will order again from this site.
Never had a problem with booking with this company, always fair with their fares, always very helpful if needed
You can trust on Tucan and you get every thing for your money you have expected.
I made a comment when placing my order, they followed super quickly with a phone call, answered my concern, delivered the product very fast at the best price I found.
There is nothing wrong to say about this international online shop ; they are serious workers. Most of the products they propose are toys that are recently made. Their retail prices are correct.
I used  twice their service, so far the staff did a perfect job. Fast, good packaging, choice with postage services. DHL is their best proposition; fast delivery service  for a good price with  a competent staff. Some products from japan that are no longer produced can be proposed elsewhere but they are usually sold very expensive.  Mandarake will propose you the same product for a lower cost that is usually close to their introductory price.
The original online shop of Toy Dorks is extremely unreliable. You will likely encounter outrageous delays and lack of honest communication if you try to do business with them. They also habitually accept orders for items they do not to  have and that you may never receive. In which case they will not give you any refund if you do not threaten them with litigation. Toy Dorks sells also in Amazon. The system of feedback prevents them to proceed as they do on their original online shop.
16 years of frustration sending money abroad ended with Transferwise. The service is amazingly quick, easy to use and far less costly than any other. I shudder at the thought I have paid for transfers in the past!
Easy to order and a website that works well. Delivery seems to take longer to France than it should eg a week from the date of ordering on line. Perhaps not the fault of Simple Supplements though.
My order was send fast and everything ok to spain. Great online store.
Perfect contact with the agents, very happy about the service and rates.
The scope was in my hand in the same week of my command!
pas facile de faire sa commande le site est mal fait a mon avis
I recommend to anyone spending 2-3 days with full-package visits to London to purchase the London pass. Due to the cost of some attractions (like the Tower of London), I definitely recommend to have it with you. Not only you will have a quick return on investment, but in such visited city like London, you will avoid hours of queues. The card is delivered to you at home if you book in advance enough. So when you arrive in London, no need to pick it up, you have it with you. You have the option to include the transportation in the pass for extra price, it's up to you and your feet! :)
J ai fait tout mes achats de noël  tout est arrivé en temps et sans deceptions
oui tout a fait un grand choix et la livraison e rapide
I close my account at Telia in April 2012, send then back the letter of cancellation etc. 6 months later I found out Telia was still charging me 80kr per month for nothing. I called the customer support who told me that indeed they have the cancellation letter and it was a mistake, I will be refund shortly. After 2 more calls I'm still waiting...the worst is that Telia sent me back 15kr instead of more than 550kr!!! This is unacceptable, thank you to refund me asap! Really really poor customer service! Edit: Thank you for the fast reply, I sent you the info you needed, looking forward for the refund Edit 2: I got refund today...finally so I edit my review from one star to 2 stars overall review with following details: - 1 star for the phone customer service, no action taken after 3 calls - 1 star for the delay... - 4 stars for the person who replied on Trustpilot and took in charge the case
Unacceptable experience with Telenor. I subscribed one year ago for 2 mobile Internet keys with automatic payment from my bank account to not have problem with unpaid invoice. First, each time they were taking money, I never get any details or anything. Second, recently I got a mail telling me I didn't pay a bill!! On one hand they take money from my account automatically and I don't know what is it and on the other hand they send me unpaid bill with fees!!! When I tried to call the customer service, they couldn't even find the bill they were taking straight from my account!! First and last time with Telenor, I stopped my contract and will never come back to such company!!
I recommend Spartoo.dk, Good products, good delivery and good packaging The only problem is from unprofessional Danish Post Office which is not delivering packages at home...a shame!
Perfect delivery, really early in the morning so the person found it before to go to work, really well packed thanks Interflora!!!
Serious website, fast delivery It would be even better with more detailed description and pictures on models
I already spend more in order Banggood! Very good site sales advice. I would do it again in order!
Nice place if you love beautiful items from New Zeland. Very good and honest communication, serious international shipping service.
Good natural products for horses and fast delivery. Advices and useful informations are displayed on the website. Despite the unprofessional aspect of the design, that company is serious.
Last year I bought a Moon rear light from Wiggle and was very satisfied with the purchase. Unfortunately  this year I broke the clip in mechanism for the support which fixes to the seat post, so I wrote to Wiggle asking if they supply spares. I fully intended to pay for the part but Wiggle offered to send me the part after contacting Moon. There was  quite a delay , which I think was on Moon's part, but Wiggle kept me informed of progress and eventually I received the part. This was a prime example of excellent customer service; I have used Wiggle for 2 years to purchase cycle clothes and equipment and have never had a bad experience with them. I recommend them highly.
A very good instrument, just a problem whith the plug which is not in the french standard and that I have to change.
I was really suprised to receive my order quickly (only a couple of days, i live in france), the products look just as good as on the website, the prices are good too. I can't wait to wear the 2 dresses i bought! Thanks boohoo!
Hi Petmeds Friends, Just dropped in to say thankyou for this supersonic delivery. I was in London when this order arrived but there was hubby, my 10 year Newfoundland and 10 year Labrador to greet the delivery service man. I have spoken about Petmeds to neighbors who order from other websites and delivery schedule is very L.O.N.G.  (I am one of them) and to TRY ordering from you instead. I do not regret my purchase from PETMEDS. Thankyou.
prix ! prestation ! rapidité ! communication ! tout y est !
Postage costs are too high considering that i speent more than 500€ in this order
Superb apartment, spacious, well equipped and tastefully. Very commercial and relatively calm district for New York Metro at the foot of the stairs of the building. Very quick and cordial relationship with Alex to our questions by e-mail to advise and to re-rent from time to time. Thanks again to Alex.
service moyuen car longue attente pour la livraison pas de mail
short prices, speed delivery, authorized return without any money very interesting
Produit conforme et bien emballé. Par un peu long entre la prise en charge et la livraison
Hi, I advise this website to rent a car, the cheaper one I have found on internet. I am using it everytime I need a car few days. I used it few times, for trips in France, Spain and Sweden, I am always satisfy.
I appreciate Cheapsmells, Their website is user friendly and easy to use. They have a wide range of products and very interesting prices on a great variety of perfumes and cosmetics. I recommend them to you.
j'utilise de temps en temps Envoimoinscher, ca ne fait pas de mal de comparer.
impressionnant la rapidité de la livraison ! en plus les articles sont de bonne qualité,félicitations pour tout
If i were the cel of this company i would be shaking and wondering how to keep this company ion business. My experience: a pretty nightmare that will try to forget and move on. shall never return or tell anyone to try to do business with them. After a difficult first experience in november 2013, I gave it another try; based on the fact that they had cleared my account and would be able to whisk through a new purchase. after one week of tries, with same historical information and same credit card, and after having spoken to my bank, they refused to confirm my purchase. finally i purchased the goods from a competitor at a competitive price using the same credit card, for which I have a line of credit of over 20000$. so what to say: to hell with part geek. no one there seem to care about customer care. so long guys i shall take my money elsewhere.
I recently placed a large order with Surfdome. It arrived in France quickly and in perfect condition. I can highly recommend the company, their promo codes mean that their prices are highly competitive so much so that i have just palced a second order with them!
I am very satisfied with the website focalprice for it is the cheapest and most reliable sites based in China I have ordered a smartphone that I have received yesterday morning I am very happy nothing to say thank you focalprice,the last 17 ​​days delivery.
en heures et en temps et toujour superb un grand a
Item was pictured with a belt clip that was not provided and that is impossible to find. Item had an option 110v/240v. Working in France I chose 240v. I got the 110v with a cheap adapter that is definitely not safe. I bought makita for quality and good safety. When I asked the customer service for help they did not provide any assistance and did not offer any kind of solutions but only a stubborn answer. DHL was very fast and efficient anyway.
Small, big, glass, wood, crystal, howlite, acrylic, silver, steel, pearls, semi-precious stones ... there are aplenty and all colors. But not only, there are also clasps and other surprising findings. All you need to forge exceptional jewelry for any each designer and beads lovers as myself! I found 8seasons by chance, but I wouldn't do without them now! They are conscientious and meticulous vendors for preparation and delivery products. I'm trying to set up my e-shop and 8seasons will stand  as one of my main suppliers because they have all my trust!
all is ok even if the delivery is in france !!
I'm fully satisfied with the products I bought, fast international delivery and good quality product
Very swift one day delivery, I ordered at 12.30 ish and the bouquet was in the hospital ward less than 3 hours later. The bouquet was apparently lovely and teh chocolates delicious.
the reservation was fast and simple,idem with the paiement by paypal. The hotel was very nice and well situated for us(we went to ziggo Dome for "the black keys concert"on 3 december). It was like the description made by other travelers,so for my next research I know where to book!!
great site to buy video games at the best price. I only buy my games through them. Allkeyshop can buy games by up to 70% savings
Interbank currency transfers have reached a new all time height in speed and efficiency.  My transfer from Sterling to Euros. requested last night, was speedily dealt with and the funds arrived in my account this morning. The HIfx site is easy to use and their regular email updates keep me informed of rate changes.
I had a good experience with this company.  Missed the membership details and had an online chat with Janet who adjusted my order and confirmed by email. Very efficient despatch.  Good range of natural products.  I'm happy and will certainly use them regularly in the future.
commander 2 boite en metal et recut les 2 abimer
Easy to find the correct product Easy to order Price is more than competitive Fast shipment
This was the first time I have ordered from a foreign company and I had to do so due to there being no UK importer of the product ordered. I was a little wary at first but I need not have worried. Purebikes service was excellent, the goods were ordered on Saturday and arrived on Thursday, this is quicker than my regular UK  supplier (Chain Reaction Cycles). All in all it was a hassle free experience once I mastered the use of Google translate.
si la navigation est simplifiée (colonne gauche - actualisation ) les agences adorent ....
I have ordered many times from Boohoo & I have never had a problem! I always get what I pay for and delivery is surprisingly quick (I live in France)!
You can trust ChepSmell ! Ten time that i order and it was nice again :
on peut commander sans hésiter et en plus la livraison est rapide
This is the second time I have bought on Cult Pens, and like last time, my order was processed quickly and without issues. I would totally buy again at Cult Pens in the future.
I am very happy with this purchase, the items look beautiful, they arrived quickly and in perfect condition they were easy to hang on the wall as well and my kitchen looks gorgeous! Thank you and thanks for delivering abroad as Well!
Good: - Price - Delivery Bad: - Charged over a week after order was placed - Price was slightly higher than stated in invoice - Bundled adapter with pedal does not work with pedal
I purchased International Cell Phone that I can use in 190 countries. It is cheap and comes with a SIM card, no hidden fees, I only pay for my calls when I make them.
I use msn's messenger and love it, best messenger out there. Msn is a comprehensive service that also offers free mail account, live passport and much more.
Easy website to use with a good range of products. The prices are competitive and the delivery is quick. I'll sure buy again from Merlin Cycles if needed.
respect et delai de livraison , je recommanderai par ce site
Very quick sending, though I live in France it only took 4 days. Good packaging and the boots are of good quality. Well done Boohoo
No problem during booking process and appartment exactly as described on the site
j ai recu ce que j ai commande en temps et en heure , rien a dire !
My father wanted to do a gift shipped to my address, but since the shipping address was different from the address on the credit card, they cancelled the order. Luckily amazon.fr had the item in stock, cheaper and free shipping....
I placed my order over the week-end and received my order the following week. The items were hand delivered and I am happy with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this company!!
2nd time I've sent money to the same destnation. Virtually nothing to do. A few clcks and the money is on it's way. Low charges and excellent service. Thanks!
This is a comprehensive cover which will enable you to travel without being concerned about the gross charges levied by car hire companies.
HIFX was recommended to me by a British friend. I was a bit concerned to make an international fund transfer outside the network of my bank, but I decided to try as he highly recommended it. This has been a fantastic, seamless, easy operation to complete. The website functions are great and easy to understnd and provide always the help you may need to complete your operation. The service is efficient and the follow-up by sms or email is very appreciated. Compare with the heavy administration and manual processes in used in my bank ( one of the largest international group), the HIFX service has no comparison. From now on, I will always used their services and will spread the message to all my friends.
We were extremely pleased with this company.  I had arranged a pick-up at the Gare du Nord and a transport from our apartment to CDG.  Both went off without a hitch and I highly recommend using them.  Their rates are very reasonable.
I can say this is a very fast service, with a good quality product, which is easy to use.
A fair price with a very good communication. I really appreciate the step by step tracking and the possibility to pay online. I don't understand why it's not the same in all MBE.
I'm very pleased with Blue Suntree even if I would have preferred that the logistic would understand that I made 2 different orders the same day... one group first with 3 items in stock and one with a 14 weeks delay (!) and another single order in stock. The result was that I received only the one item, without the 3 others. I must precise that the delivery fees were equivalent regarding the mixes I've tried on the website, so the people in charge could have grouped all the items in stock and I would have waited 14 weeks for the rest. My mistake on the first place, of course, but as it's not easy to order with clicks, someone could be able to fix these kind of aberration ! LB
le site de sportshop est parfait pour les commandes par internet
Completely faultless - accurate descriptions, prompt service and the site easy to use. Whilst I appreciate that postage costs are significant and therefore would make, say, ordering individual items prohibitive, It would be good to have access to a lower weight/ quantity package, maybe half the weight for maybe £9/10 despatch costs.
Je te recommande ce site car tout y est bien fait
Le service client est extrêmement efficace et la livraison super rapide : un excellent site de vente!
I would highly recommend shopping with Britsuperstore if it were not for the shipping fees which I find really high (specially concerning comparatively "small" orders). That could make me think twice in the future.
We rented a 7 seater for 10 days for our trip in UK. The car is provided by Alamo that run by Europcar. Although the person in charge of Europcar was trying hard to sell extra insurance coverage, but I guess all the other agents are the same. The car is brand new and we paid much cheaper than what normally charged by Europcar. Good feeling so far and no bad surprise.
c est site de reference,on commander sans probleme le service est bien fait
I was amazed I purchased sneakers on a friday, the next wednesday it was arrived. top website!! recommended !!

I order on Thursday night and receive my package on Tuesday morning. Thank you
I am french, I don't speak very well, but safercigs.co.uk. is very good, speed, this shop is ok !
de la prise de commande a la livraison tout impeccable super
Thank You - great service. Don't think I have ever had so speedy delivery. We made the order Sunday and revived Tuesday in France without any ekstra charge... It was actually with FREE Delivery. The product was packed well, size and description was as explained on the  and we are very happy with the buy We will recommend this shop any time
I ordered 4 Eames DSR inspired chairs which would have been far beyond my budget with other providers. Although the announced delivery time is very long and the tracking system unreliable, I understand pricing comes with rational logistics, and the wait is worth the result. Communication with customer service was perfect after a mistake I made in my order. These great design chairs are made of quality material and give a great "caché" to my apartment, and can definitely recommend Retro Furnish to those seeking for designer inspired furniture.
vite fait ,bien fait et pas cher.que demander de plus ?
i ordered akey for expansion of D3 called reaper of souls by paypal. Just a few minutes after i recived the key, enter into my battlenet account and i begun to play...It can't be difficult to do more easy and fast to play ^^
two days as delivery export , length strap included .
I bought men and women skincare products on hecosmetics a couple of times and was always impressed by the quality of the service: fast delivery, personal greeting, nice package. These small things that make a difference, especially when you have had bad experience in the past like me! The products are also of good quality and the fact there is no nasty chemical in them is reassuring. There is also an attractive price range starting from (very) cheap organic cosmetics. I can only recommend this online store. Marine  - UK/ France
super site pour nos animaux, tarif et livraison rapide et pas cher tout est parfait a recommander
de plus en plus rapide par rapport à la commande jusqu'au moment de la livraison
This specific wand handle was no longer available on the French Dyson website and the UK Dyson website didn't allow to ship to France. Partmaster had it and sent it without making all a fuss about it. Thanks!
I can't say much more than I already did. My order arrived before I had the time to even think about when it would. Living in Portugal, that is a statement! Otherwise, very pleasant and customer friendly exchange. I will definitely shop on Strings Direct when the need arises. Thank you!
The pick up and return of the car was quick and easy, with excellent service from the local staff. We were also very pleased with the car itself
Have ordered knitted neck warmer, never had such a warm winter
I am a client of AuCOFFRE.com since several years. The service is outstanding, contact is easy to get help or advice. I have seen the evolution of this company during those years, improving the service, the website, and adapting itself to new laws and regulations in the interest of its customers.
I am a French visitor. Before getting tickets i exchanged with staff by e mail and received immediate answers it was reassuring and i bought tickets. taken bus was very easy as you can catch it at every stops. tours are complete with many stops in major areas and place of interest. guided tour in old dubai is very interesting i loved it allows us to see and come back on our own. I recommend bigbus tour and everywhere in the world as i used it.
I'm from Belgium and I was a little bit afraid for my first order because of the shipping. I had read a lot about problems of shipping in France so I doubt. (but then I heard that the problem didn't come from boohoo but from the french post) so I've ordered from the UK website and the shipping was very fast (3-4 working days instead of 6) I was very happy when I received my parcel. The clothes are great and I've chosen the right sizes thanks to the informations of the models wearing the clothes. If they wear size 8, I choose my real size, if they wear size 10, I choose one size up etc. So it was easy to order.
Thank god for M&S Shopping online! From France, I can now order abroad, and I even managed to place an Xmas order to New Zealand for my parents with a free shipping offer! Perfect! Kept up-to-date with various emails during the shipment process. Shame about no free returns internationally, or in Europe at least.
After having dealt with Quiz, and an employee called Adil on many occasions, I am left furious and extremely unhappy with this company. 1. The delivery time to my country is stated as 3-5 working days on their website. The parcel turned up 6 days after despatch! It was therefore late. Adil, nor any other employees at Quiz refused to aknowledge that it was late! 2. Received my £60 dress, which was made of poor quality, was not at all as expected from the image on the website. 3. Paid £7.50 to return the item, and Customer Service (Adil) refuses to refund my return charged based on the 1st two points. Still refuses to acknowledge delay of delivery. In general, very poor Customer Service (I work in Customer Service myself!). I've spent way too much time emailing back and forward. A very angry customer that is out of pocket. Even 1 star is too many.
Nice products, cheaper than anywhere else, great communication and very fast shipping to France. It's always perfect!
Les cartouches ne correspondaient pas a ma marque d imprimante Ni la noir ni la couleur
Nothing to say about the quality of this site both on service delivery; Are not used to being ordered abroad I was a little worried but everything went very well and I renovellerai my orders at smith & morris.
On another site (Jules B) payment is made in Euros and there is no exchange fees (costs 5 Euros more than the advertised amount.) Cordially.
The attention of your sales person in guiding us during our purchase as well as the follow up of the order and the availability of the furniture on time was very much appreciated. An excellent team of people that assisted us in our acquisition.
We bought a large wine-coloured shaggy rug,which was sent to us here in France. The staff at Rug House were very helpful,describing the colour and characteristics of the rug very well,and offering to send a sample.The sample confirmed that the rug was what we were looking for,and once the order was placed,delivery was swift and efficient. Time will tell how the rug wears,in a home with two large dogs,but we are delighted so far.
facile de mettre les articles a vendre et on arrive vraiment a vendre les articles
tout c est bien deroule , de la reservation a l appartement
kept updated of the order status when stock out. kept udpated when goods shipped quick transport and tracking very good
I came across Merlin Cycles' web site almost by accident. I was looking for a pair of winter gloves for mountain biking. Google pointed me to Merlin Cycles. The price was competitive (read: better than CRC), shipping was very reasonable (I live outside the UK) and the gear arrived in no time. Very good experience!
Low price and instant delivery, I'm very satisfied, I will certainly buy my next game at go2arena
I became a Member of Wowcher a little while ago because they offer great deals for a very low cost. I have bought and redeemed a few vouchers, 2 of them being a trip abroad. The Customer Service I got while booking this holiday was brilliant, it was fast and easy, and I'm very pleased. (That the reason why I gave 3 stars and not only 1!) However, I also bought some goods a month and a half ago, and I'm still waiting for the delivery. I can understand the delivery is late, it happens. But I don't understand the nonsense I got from the Customer Service. I contacted them 3 times regarding the delivery issue. The first time I received a reply within 24hours. The message was a bit dismissive, they were aware of the delivery issue on this product and asked that I should be patient. I waited 10 days, still nothing in the post, I then sent a 2nd message, no replies. I finally received an answer to my 3rd email. I had asked when should I expect the delivery or refund of my purchase; after 30 days waiting I felt it was a reasonable request. Unfortunately, my question was never answered, instead I received a template, a pre-written email that must be sent out to dozens of customers everyday. Wowcher's CS is surely clueless about making a customer feeling valued...
You changed the type of car, you charged more money than the agreed price, but for a smaller car and with less insurance. You said that the type of car I reserved was't available, but days, weeks and months later, the car I reserved was still offered on your webpage for the same price. You did't reply my emails.
service commercial au top, site internet facile d utilisation , parfait +++++
i am happy of my perfumer london of women arrived quickly thank you LMoricel
super cite , presentation claire , commande rapide et soignée , bravo
Articles bought on ChemistDirect as they were the cheapest, also quick delivery postage a bit expensive though as I live in France. Good service it's not the first time I buy from them and will buy again.
Delighted with my first purchase, will definitively recommend and order again very soon. And the free delivery for order above €30 is brilliant!
i don t speak English verry well but i am verry happy to my buy
Lots of choice, easy order, but even if the shipping has been done quickly, it took too much time for the delivery in France! But I will certainly order again.
These chocolates are devilishly good. The texture is unlike anything else and the taste is out of this world. Hard going back to cadburys after having tasted them.
I ordered and on the next day my package had arrived. Nothing was missing, great service overall.
I ordered a guitar amplifier cab (2x12"), Pro Series. I received very good advices, very fast responses by email, placed the order on a Tuesday from France and received the shipment on Friday! How can it be better?
Beaucoup de choix et pas de soucis pour la livraison !
You know, when I discovered you I was amazed with the prices you offered when compared with the other companies. Congratulations. You offer excellent prices and the delivery is fast. You are reliable and you do what you claim. You are simply the best.
I was very surprised to receive the game in Time and as promised . To be recommanded . I Will order from you Again. Congratulations.
Low cost delivery means also that you can sometines receive a shoe box deterioreted (fortunately not the shoes).
Very good experience for the first time I order at Urban Industry. Low sale prices and very fast shipping to France (5 days to arrive). I warmly recommmand this site !
Thank you. You are a real professional. When I am looking for sport or cool stuff I check before on your site. If I have a problem  or if I made a wrong choice you reply back quick and I feel rassured.
We are very happy of our transaction with this online store! We ordered 4 chairs on May the 8th and it last 1 month to receive them. The time was a bite long but we were satisfied to find chairs very well packed and well made. You can purchase on this website with eyes closed. We will buy again too in a few months.
A very easy company to deal with, everything I have ordered from them has turned up the next day.  It's nice to buy online on a site where you don't have to spent 20 minutes creating an account & answering questions on what is the second letter of your first teachers first pets name.  The fact that you can pay with PayPal makes it even more convenient.  You can often buy the same things on fLeaBay for less but it then turns out to be coming from China & there is duty to pay.  When I needed an unusual combination of controllers & lighting they were quite happy to put a bundle together at a fair price.
I'm mainly interested in the bedlinen, since I run a b&b.  My guests always praise the quality of the bedlinen, and say how attractive it is.  I like the wide range of fabrics and colours, and the prices are reasonable. The only criticism I have of the bedlinen is the stitching along the button flap, which comes undone and needs redoing from time to time.  Also, the bedspreads crease a lot if left on the bed at night.  This means a lot of extra ironing.  It would be nice if they could make similar non- crease bedspreads.  I've just bought some woollen throws to put on the beds instead of the bedspreads.  They are nice and soft.
I got a very positive feedback from my family about the flowers
tout est ok pas de retard ds les commandes tout est bien emballé et il y en a pour toutes les bourses
Ordered a Big Air Extreme 14' trampoline a year or so back. All fine.  Recently needed to re-order a net for the enclosure (should the net need replacing a year in..?  anyway.... )  It arrived yesterday. Very little resemblance to the original!  Instead of the handy hooks on elasticated bands to attach the net at the bottom, we have 187 eyelets in a flimsily stitched hem and 20 or so ties.  So you count the holes, divide by the number of ties in the bag and go round tying bows to secure the thing. Instead of the intelligently conceived overlap and velcro set-up for the door, we have duffle-coat style toggles.  So,  will our  6 and 8 year-old kids leap up raring to go and faff around with the toggles before they start jumping around....?  Doubt it.. This is a seriously down-graded bit of kit.  Yet another case of a company coming to market with a good product and then some suit / bean counter saying, 'Now.. is there any way we can do this more cr*ppily to increase our margins?''  Pretty disgusted, guys.
I benchmarked all the possible pram sellers on the market, including auctions websites, specialised and non specialsed stores for the particular model/brand I was looking for. I litterally spent hours on it and finally choose Pramworld, which I did not know before. Reason was simple: their package for my travel system was the cheapest. I ended receiving my parcel in 3 days, and it was exactly what I expected. My friends would not believe me when I told them the price. I will definitely recommend Pramworld to any of my friends willing to buy prams on line.
The saga continues - wrong waste sent - we were installing abroad and had to buy another - still waiting to hear (1 month later) about a refund.  Thermostatic value faulty - they have at least sent another but won't be able to check that one until we return to our home abroad.  Disaster after sales.  Not pleased.  Would not use again and would warn others before purchasing!
moi qui suis loin de tout dans un tout petit village , je trouve tout en un clic , impossible de me passer de google , merci .
Always fast delivery of the key (~30mins). I had no problems of bad keys for 3 bought games (one of them was MMO). And good prices !
good quality of service and unbeatable prices. I've bought item on friday and i received it on monday! Incredible!
Commande conforme et livraison rapide ; Que demander de plus ?
This company is just really perfect!! My mother loved her marvelous bouquet which arrives very fresh and as described on the web site:) This is not the first time I'm sending flowers with FloraQueen and always I'm so happy about their service. You can trust this company beyond doubt!
5 vols de prise en main et après , on fait des miracles . TB RAS .
I appreciate that European train booking is problematic, but I seem to get the alerts automatically when it is 91 days until the trip, without anyone actually looking to see if the reservations are actually open. this has happened twice. Otherwise, the service is good. Email questions are answered fairly promptly, and personally (not just generic FAQs)
reservation hotel et vol pour les etats unis conforme a la demande
I placed several orders and I'm always satisfied by service and the price.
I buy GWII on this site, I have a problem whith my cdkey. I contact the costumers service and they help me very quickly. very good contact and service.
un tarif intelligent et enfin la corvée de sable à chat en deux minutes top merci sophie M
Tu es mon site préféré, à la pointe de la mode
I've found nice apartments on Housetrip that are a great deal for the money. It's definitely much preferable than trying to book a hotel for a similar price.
very good frequency, bus stops are well located, very relaxing trip (despite the traffic jams) and the boat tour was also very nice. Warmly recommended
I ordered a book two weeks ago. One week after I received the printed book which was well packaged. The only imperfect thing is that between the moment after the order and the moment that they told you the book was sent, there was no information. There is no status of the order and no tracking of delivery either. So you just wait and have no idea when you receive it. Fortunately, it just took 10 days that I received the book after order.
Love the knitwears of this site.they have nice graphic patterns and are not expensive. I ordered twice online and the delivery service is good. I have never problem with it.
I have ordered twice on this site and all went very well. The delivery is fast and trustful. Since I visit from time to time their shop I know well which size is fit for me. So I have never problem with shopping on this site. Just love its minimalist style.
It's no doubt that amazon has a very good reputation for their large product choice, competitive prices and efficient delivery system. They have the best delivery system i've experienced. So 100% confidence in shopping on amazon's site.
I love the brand, but sometimes the collections are weird maybe just because the most of their collection is fit for tall girls. I ordered a parka once. The delivery is quite fast and you can track it. The graphics on the packaging is nice.
I visited the shop several times. Their collection and accessories are very nice and some of them are particular. The website is very well done. I ordered a bag at this site. Three working days later, the article arrived. The delivery is very fast and you can track it online. The packaging is nice and the product is well wrapped, of good quality. Really happy experience.
I look for a mini packbag for long time. Finally on this site, there's one mini packbag I've loved to buy. I ordered it in middle september. Then two days later, I'm told that the package was on delivery (from uk to france). I waited.... Three weeks later, I didn't received any package. I've left the address of my work which has no problem to receive the letters and packages. I had to contact the client service of TOPSHOP and was told that it seemed that the package was lost! With standard delivery fee of 6 euros, you have a tracking number (but it doesn't work in france) so you have no way to know where your package is! Then I re-ordered the same packbag. Two days later I was told that my order had to be cancelled because the product is out of stock. Though TOPSHOP gives a refund, I took one month to buy just nothing. What a 'happy' experience! I ordered the clothes/accessories on several other sites and have never problem of receiving them and with the same delivery costs, you can really TRACK your package and they won't be lost on the way of delivery and fast!
Whenever I asked a technical question, I got the answer in less than 24 hours. I recommend this web hosting !
I am very happy about this website and the products that it offers. I only give four stars instead of 5 because they are not transparent enough about the origin of their products. Even though their supplements look and taste right, they are so cheap that I wonder about their quality. A bit more information on the origin of the milk powder for instance is needed ( by the way, I am not convinced about their "certificates". They are just a marketing trick). The delivery is very fast and I appreciate that a lot.
I use the airbnb platform since summer 2011 and I rent my place to guests from all over the world. It is until now a perfect product. My guests are happy, I am happy and airbnb too of course. The customer service is very quick and helpful, the website is well design and simple to use. The payment system is very efficient and automatic so it remove a lot of stress in the process. The airbnb team even invited me to a cocktail meeting in a nice bar a few months ago. I warmly  recommend airbnb to everyone.
Perfect service! I usually don't write reviews but now I feel the need to inform future customers about my experience. It was my first order on lenstore.co.uk and it couldn't have been better. I usually buy every year exactly the same brand of contact lenses (Proclear Toric) on different websites and this time I've experienced the cheapest price and fastest service in 10 years. So I am very happy and I recommend this website.
I ordered a pair of shoes which where out of stock in other pages, and for my surprise they were way cheaper using a promotion code and the shipment was super fast! I'm really happy with the web page and would it recommend it 100%
No problem, buy games for download, license received by email in due time.
I chose Sky Tours because I found the cheapest plane tickets on its web site. When I chose my tickets, I had a little problem with cancellation fee. I wrote an e-mail to the customer service. The service answered me just one hour after and refund me the fee. Really efficient, and you can trust sky tours!!!
Although you need to have a printed reciever note with you to get the Berlin Pass at the Hard Rock Café, thanks to iPod and Airprint we get this process done in no time and get our two passes instandly, as we decided it on impuls. We used it well, although it's impossible to enjoy the attractions within the limitation of 3 days.
Great rates - on a €3,000 transaction I saved £32 compared to the next best quote, and £90 compared to my high street bank. The money was in the recipient's account the next day, in less than 24 hours
Car was perfect and easy to drive, everything went smoothly at the car rental agency. I can only recommend your services !
I had planned an intercontinental flight a few months ago departing from Frankfurt, Germany to Africa. So I needed to get another one to fly there. So I went onto Bravofly  website to see what was available same day of departure. I found a very good deal at very low price to fly there even cheaper than any Low cost airline company but flying with a top one. sO I wil visit again Bravofly for last need flights.
I have to admit the your duffle coat is exactly what is advertised on your web site...
It was a bit slow to get my manual but other than that, they thoroughly followed the whole process of my training. Good teacher.
An expedition No. 500000779 without tracking number, livery shown in my account but not received I will never be ordering more on this site
this is an amazing service! i ordered business cards and they never arrived (i chose the postal delivery),  after i explained the urgency to the customer service.  They immediately printed for free a new set of busienss cards, and gave me a 50% discount on sending through an express service. and i got my card on the same day of my travel ! i cannot but appreciate this!
No surprise except the full tank to be paid in advance !
This is where I buy most of my lingerie and swimwear. My favorite brand (Freya) is hard to find in France and rather expensive here. Figleaves offers an amazing selection for all sizes at fair prices. Over the years, I've only had one issue with delivery, which was solved very quickly and efficiently by customer service. I wish I could enjoy the same free shipping/free return policy as English customers do, as returns from France to the UK can be a bit costly. However, considering the overall quality of the products they offer and their prices, it still is cheaper to buy from them and pay postage if I order more than one or two items than go to a local shop. Would definitely recommand this site, especially to ladies who have trouble finding products in their bra size in regular shops.
Over the past 18 months, I've placed 3 orders through Brastop. While the first two arrived very quickly, the third one didn't. Customer service was amazing in dealing with this issue. After the required 20 day wait period, they did the lost package procedure, and resent the lost items to me. International mail can be tricky, no matter which site you order from (I will be using registered mail from now on, to limit issues of lost/stolen packages in the mail in the future). In my experience, Brastop did a great job of solving the problem. I will definitely order from them again and recommand them to my friends.
I made an order of 4 different  articles, 3 of them were claimed to be in stock and one available with 2 weeks delay. 2,5 weeks after my order I received an email informing that my table will arrive to them 7-8 weeks later thus the total delay for me will be 10 weeks instead of 2. The email contained no information on other items,  so I asked. After several mails I got an answer that they are in stock but will also be sent 10 weeks in delay... I claimed this unacceptable. The story continued with endless waiting on  the hotine (which was charged 12 centimes per minute plus the operator charges). Finally I managed to speak to someone, and cancel the table order so that the other items could be sent. Now they should be on their way... but the DHL tracking system doesn't work so I keep my fingers crossed. What irritated me most in this history is that the web site continues to claim 2 weeks delivery delay for the table I was told to receive with 10 weeks delay.  And  at the same time, I received an AbienteDirect newsletter advertising the products from the company behind my table. My very  table was pictured with a text something like "order now, available immediately"...   Thus I am not very satisfied with my experience with AmbienteDirect, sorry to say.
I bought two items from the seller (blackberry cases) and was highly pleased by the speed of the delivery & the quality of the items.
I always come back to this website for my reservations! It is with Directferries that I get the best prices.
I bought a polo and a jacket on the webside, the same day the order was already on transit. I don't live in UK, and my package arrived less than a week later. I opened it and was very impressed by the quality and the lightness of the clothes.
This site is very well and gives a voucher followed by the order and the delivery deadline is correct. On the other hand the prices are very expensive and their margin I think is very good!
Just so simple, there were good deals on 3 for 2, I ordered and delivery arrived within 48 hours
Really good website to buy games at low prices with no risk at all.
Extremely good value for all what is offered in the package deal. Shorter queues in a lot of places, very convenient with the children
respect de la livraison et la batterie commandé est bien la bonne ! great !
Very easy to order the currency on-line. The office where I picked my money up from in the airport was well signed and the clerk was very friendly and efficient. I would consider doing the same again.
Facile pour la commande, encore plus facile pour la livraison et top pour l'emballage
I had ordered the Tissot Lelocle watch a week ago and I received it today within the  promised time span ,i.e., 3 to 5 working days.The item was well-packaged and came with the two-year international warranty documents.The watch is beautiful, as described, and so happy with my purchase.
The advantage of this website is that you get your Xbox Live Gold code within seconds. It is delivered by e-mail and directly displayed on your screen.
I ordered 50 business cards & 1 cards' case. I was first of all disapointed due to the delay of the delivery (10 days rather than expected 3-5 days). Plus, within the 50 cards, about 12 cards had some ink marks on it & the cards'case was slightly damaged. However, I was still satisfied with the quality of the remaining cards. Then, I sent a request on Smileprint's website. I got an answer during the day-time and the person of the assistance offered to send me the same 50 cards + a new cards' case. I accepted the offer and I asked if I could changed the content of the card a little bit. The person was very reactive and accepted my request + she did the change for me. Less than 5 days later, I received my new package. I thank Smileprint for its reactivity. However, I have observed the same defects in the new package : about 10-12 cards with ink marks + the cards'case slightly damaged... My advice would be to control these aspects for the improvement of your services. Otherwise, your reactivity convinced me to recommend you to my friends for their future orders.
I am very happy of my order I will do a new order
I find easily a memory for an old and special PC for a reasonable price. The product worl well and the delivery was really fast.
There's lots of competition out there these days for fast, efficient currency deals at great rates but Currency Change really deliver! Personalised service, no hassle - job done!
Do not expect big deal with this site, it is only the normal price of the hotel you have chosen what it sell you, and it takes 15% if you cancel after the reservation is made, it's usually better to book directly on the sites of hotels to truly do good deal and earn lots of money...
I had the goods shipped to France and everything arrived promptly. I would use SoActive again.
Excellent holiday thanks lowcost holidays. Everything went well, flights, transfers and hotel booking. Very pleased will use lowcost holidays again. My sister and bro in law also impressed. Madeira is a beautiful place to spend a holiday.
Delivery was very quick, costumes looked great, had a cracking party thanks to them!
I ordered my first flight travel with ebookers, and was not disappointed. The hotel I booked was clean, very cozy, and cheap too. I also liked the way I was able to choose the cheapest flight in one week, as my travel dates were not fixed. In two words : Great service !
I experienced very good service, I had sent a mail that I would like the wine to arrive 25 July. And so the package was delivered the 25, on time. Thanks!
Everything is perfect just one black point the delivery time more than 10 days is too much when you need your product quicker
Good choice, payment without any problem Delivery a bit longer than expected
essai que de la cartouche noire et tout est ok . ras
The best when you stay at home, when you are watching TV, when it's cold... The best
I appreciated the range of products and quality of brands , quick delivery ... I recommend
juste un peu plus long que d habitude pour la livraison
I liked to purchased from you, and I definitely will do in the future.
It's great to read reviews without having to read between the lines.  Also, if you've never had dealings with a company before, it's reassuring to see if it's listed on Truspilot. And best of all, if at any time in the future I change my mind I can come back and edit my opinion!
I have no hesitation in recomending Cebonat. I was kept informed of every step of the order and  the product arrived quickly and well packaged.
The key i ordered was a global key and i receive a steam gift. It was not specified anywhere on G4k that it was a steam gift. My game can be ban by steam anytime. I'am disapointed. First and last order on this website.
N'hesitez pas un service rapide et competent meme si les prix restent corrects sans plus
the video is so funny, i see almost everyday, it makes me laugh ofen
the price is really really cheap, but the envoi is too longtime.

For the lovers of old games, this website is a must. They offer a great selection of old games at great prices. Recommended.
This website offers an array of high quality baby clothes collections, from newborns to 5 year olds.
On this site I found some really good looking and original knobs for my doors at affordable prices.
No hassle payment, fast delivery and high quality food for dogs.
No problems at all with all venues/ clubs expecting us - it made it very easy to enjoy the weekend. Thanks Chillisauce.
Very userfriendly website, with very good prices. Will book again with them next time.
I now live in France and as always the service is outstanding and the products fantastic!! I recommend the company to all my friends, English and French.
could not get any reply when phoning your helpline even when the computer  said there was no one waiting also you do not answer your emails
Easy to order and delivered in the next few days even at international. Good service.
product conform as ordered quick delivery good value for money I am satisfied
First I ordered a bunch of flowers for my sister's birthday. While I received the confirmation that she would receive it on D day, she did 2 days later. She then sent me a picture of the bunch which was quite small although I did not order the basic one. Twice disappointing. I won't recommend it.
I've ordered 3 times at Banggood. Still no problem with them. They answer very quickly at each mail (24h maximum delay) and it is also very easy to talk with them through the chat. For my last order, I changed my mind and asked for a refund that I have received in less than 24h on my Paypal account.
