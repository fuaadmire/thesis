Nice and easy sales process with quick delivery of a good well packaged product.
Delivered in good time and at a good price, cannot ask for much more.
It has been over 1 month since my stay at this average hotel. Since then I have exchanged countless emails and phone calls to try and get a refund for a double payment they took off my credit card and still I have nothing. Monday morning I will be reporting these people to the police for theft and card fraud. Pathetic
I took my 2 year old son to get his new grown up bed from ØnskeBørn Køge last weekend and my god, I have never in my life witnessed such pathetic staff in my life. #1 - We finally got assistance after waiting for 20 minutes to be told the bed we wanted was out of stock but we could order it. So we said we would look around at some others in the shop as we did not want to disappoint our little boy. #2 - We decided on another one and had to wait another 20 minutes for another lady to assist. #3 - We asked to make sure the screws for the bed would be silver and not copper brown which looked horrible on the white bed we had seen in another shop. She guaranteed us they would be silver. #4 - She spent another 30 minutes up-selling us on the best mattress and sheets which we she helped us select before going off to get the bed. #5 - She then came back to tell us that the other bed was also out of stock too. #6 - At this point my son was screaming the shop down and wanted to leave so we decided to give in and just order the bed and wait. We paid for the sheets and mattress and drove home with no bed. #7 - Note that this had so far taken us around 2 hours including the time to drive to the store and back. #8 - When we got home we realized she had given us the wrong sized mattress. We then decided if we was going to have to make another trip that we will get a damn bed. #9 - My wife went back to the store, exchanged the mattress and purchased one of the beds we was not too excited about just so our son could have his bed after all of this trouble. #10 - My wife drove home and I began removing the old bed from my sons room before starting to build the bed. #11 - After all of this time I opened the screw bag to fix the bed together and to my anger the screws were the horrible copper/brown colour we had specifically asked about and been promised that they would be silver. #12 - We called very angry to the shop and insisted they should help or come and collect the bed as we refused to do so. The lady apologized and said she will call the warehouse and ask about getting some silver ones and call us right back. #13 - We waited and waited and no call came back so I made the bed anyway given that I could exchange the screws afterwards. #14 - We finally got a return call on the Monday (2 days later) to say they could order us some silver screws and the costs would be 150dk for the bag and 50kr for delivery. So in the end we wasted over 3 hours of our time to end up with a bed that we never really wanted and even worse with horrible brown screws in it which look terrible. And even after all of that the staff at ØnskeBørn Køge want to charge us another 200kr to send us the screws we was promised were included in the 1st place. ØnskeBørn Køge - 0 Stars out of 5
User friendly webshop, fair price and even a phone call 30 minutes before delivery.
Det er en fin side som giver et let overblik.
Det fungere bare super godt. jeg er glad for at jeg valgte at handle hos romatiske gaver.
ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
I ordered a costume one day at around 4-5pm, and the next day it was in my mailbox when i came home. that is just absolutely perfect.
I had been their customer for nearly 8 years.Recently my loan interest rates have been hiked so much, that I have found other places and little research and finally settled for an online bank called Pensam. I think there are other good banks than Pensam, but, when I find the good one, I will surely change it to that good one. Danske bank is expensive and very expensive and I do not recommend this to an normal people. Danske bank er dyr og rigtig dyr, kan Ikke anbefales til alminidelig folk.
Ordered my contact lenses. Order was delivered on time by FedEx to my office.
Quality is really bad. If you complain nobody will answer you. Even with 50% discount you should find another company. I have bought a photo book and a calendar. I have never seen such a bad resolution and pictures which are red or green colored.
rigtig god side som osse har fået en facebook gruppe nu join us )
I think it is a very good thing that you offer the payers to purchase accessories for the shoes, so if they need anything, they can buy it right away. All I all I have been very pleased with how fast I got my shoes and I will differently use shoesandfriends.com again.
Det var atter en fornøjelse at handle hos House of Kids. Kan kun anbefale at handle her :o)
I have been a customer at sportsdirect.com for a while now. I must say that their prices are fair and they quickly send your order and at a fair price. But they big issue with sportsdirect.com is the very very poor customer service. If you have to send something back, it will cost you money. Also I have tryed that I had received a wrong item and I wrote an e-mail to the customer service. After 5 days waiting they wrote me back, that I had to return the item(s) to them and they would refund the costs for shipping. So I send it back and 2½ weeks later I received a new package from them. But once again it was the wrong items. They again I send it back to them , this time with pictures of the things I had ordered. But once again they send the wrong items back to me. Also I still haven´t received any money back for my shipping costs. I have tried to call them, but I can´t get through. I have written them many e-mails and normal response time is "only" 5 days. And you never have a dialog with the same supporter, and then you always get a standard answer. My advice would be, if you know what you want and are 100% sure about size etc.. Than sportsdirect.com is a good place to buy your things. But do you need any help what so ever, I would say: Go buy somewhere else. The customer service in not existing.
I order some computer accessories and got it on the next day.  I searched all over the net only i can find it in ELextra.dk. That is really cool.
I just ordered a webhotel Yesterday and get in 2 sec the login to my webhotel after i paid. Very fast.  but the domain name for Dk is still high about 123 hope they will make it down under 100.
It been nice trip last time to Mallorca. We been in alcudia pins hotel. very comfortable and enjoyable holiday place specially family with all age group 2-14.  But couldn't find a travel like that anymore from spies.....
LaCie 1TB hard drive. I placed my order in the evening and it arrived the next day, brilliant service.
After a lot of hassle that took around 1 months time we finally managed to convince them that we were entitled to our refund from the hostel and as an apology we got a coupon/gift voucher for 44 dollars from hotels.com So I can forgive them. But I hope they would create better communication between themselves and their hotels to avoid this kind of stuff from happening again.
I ordered 4 pair cycle shorts. Got an email next day saying we have only 2 pair so can we knock your order down to 3 pair? I wrote back asking how it was posible to send 3 pair when they said there was only 2.Got what i regard as a snooty reply saying obviously we can only send 2 when we only have 2. No excuse me we made a mistake.I sent a copy of the email back to them and they said yes I know what I wrote .It was a mistake. No apology there. I promptly cancelled my order and will never buy fro them again.
A good shopping experience where value for money is the key. Would not hesitate to recommend Fisknu.dk to any one who values a good and fair deal.
A very pleasant experience to shop with Mytrendyphone. the delivery was very quick in fact I received my item the day after.Well done Mytrendyphone
Denmark's best web shop for fitness and bodybuilders.The price is always fair and some times really cheap. Its run by people who know there stuff. No bullshit the real deal.
My order came the very next day.Its refreshing to deal with such a professional company.
I buy all my supplements here and can recommend dymatize protein and horse power kreatine.
Er glad for at handle hos DampShop, men synes deres levering er for langsom....
Great website, super fast delivery. I can definitely recommend it and for sure I'll use it again.
I can only recommend thebikeshop.de, ive mailed with them for around 7-8 days before making my purchase. they helped me out gettin the correct gear for the bike and size, they get 5 stars from me... Im not done shopping there simple and fast.
levering tog kun 2 dage - alt var bare i orden
If you buy something from them and get a problem, they will help you anyway they can. Great service!
If you do not have the money to purchase one of their overpriced rooms, you will be chased around the ferry and being told that it is not a camping site. So if you are planning an overseas trip during the night, and do not intend to pay for a room (which is not compulsory), you will not be able to find a place to sleep even though you brought your own gear.
Ordered my books online, and received them shortly after! everything went just as advertised and i never needed to contact them for anything!

This is the second time I buy aluminium-rims including tires from www.billigalu.dk. Just like the first time, "billigalu.dk" delivers - on time .. and that is VERY fast - the correct ordered rims and tires - balanced and ready for installation/use - including bolts, spacers and whatever is needed - at - what I think - is a fair price What else do you want?? The only room for improvement I see, is if "billigalu.dk" was able to »3D-print the rims and tires on my car on demand« .. I guess, we will have to wait some time before THAT technology is available ;o) So .. all the best recommendations from me, Thor
The ordering was easy, and when i had to change sizes, there was no problems, perfect. I will do it again, and feel safe.
Recently I've been looking for a piece of furniture and doing a market research. At that point of time Jysk came along with a very attractive offer as a part of their birthday celebration campaign. Visiting a local Jysk shop in Valby I was pleasantly surprised with the customer service offered. A consultant not only  answered my questions but proactively suggested several options that would match my body shape (not the most expensive ones though). Jysk offers a free delivery of goods once you make a purchase over a certain amount of krones. Bear in mind, they are partnering with a third party delivery company that brings your purchase all the way up to your house (flat) door. It is your  responsibility to take stuff inside (Jysk covers the insurance only up to your door). Goods were delivered on the agreed day. There is an option of 100-day reconsider (you can return the purchase in case you are not satisfied with a purchase).

The second try went really smooth. Got exactly what I was searching for, the item was delivered in two days. Quick & smooth! Love when companies are listening to the voice of their market! Well done!!! --------------------------------- I've been happy to discover the extensive variety of phone accessories, in particular iPhone cases and covers. Once I've discovered a gem for myself, the web let me ordered it and promised a prompt delivery. Happy days! Unfortunately a month later after several notifications about the item being out of stock and unconfirmed delivery date I had to change the order and choose some other product. Three months since my purchase the Customer Support has contacted me and told me that the payment didn't go through and asked to pay again. All fair, no double charge at the end. Yet my initial expectations of the service were not  met. All in all, the shop is great, the quality of the products is high. Their operational side could be slightly improved though.
Been caught by the sales rep. at the Valby st. on my way to work. He did his job pretty cool, within a min asked me what provider I'm currently using, shared the news that M1 just been awarded with a top category rank on Trustpilot, that is does not charge monthly fee. The offer sounded interesting, especially since I had the need to switch to someone cheaper than "3". I wish the Co would be a bit more open-minded towards expats in DK. The sales guy did not want to speak English at any cost. I've got an idea that the company do not embrace the international students market at all. Another thing, I wish the guy explained me in more details that the transition process will take a longer while, it's been almost 2 months since then, still can't use the tlf. number. On a positive side, I feel like being taken care by the M1, they are sending follow up mails, offering service help. That is a plus! With my previous provider I had to wait for 20 min on hold waiting for the Service Center to pick up. Wish them good luck in growth and hope my phone will serve me at its best soon!
Ordered (DKK 1649) wooden sand pit and received an poorly wrapped, partial delivery - despite the lack of information, it was clear that this was not all. Inspecting the delivery, I could the wood to be of extremely poor quality and the craftsmanship even worse. Holes had been drilled in the wrong places and then covered and there were cracks and other problems as well. Calling MM Konsol, they confirmed that they had forgotten to send most of the items. I asked specifically to make sure there were instructions and screws in that delivery, which however MM Konsol refused to check, confirming it was definitely there. Of course it was not, and now, weeks and many emails later, we still have not received the promised delivery. Promises have been made, but there is not delivery on those either. This is the last time I have bought anything from MM Konsol / other reviews must have been made the themselves.. Avoid MM Konsol / that is my best advise. Brgds/Jonas
A really good website to make a good bargain! Prices are way cheaper than on other websites, so I have picked up many very good deals. Bought several Christmas presents there, just be aware of the long delivery time. However, the cheap prices makes up for that!
som altid en super god oplevelse at handle hos jer !
No free Coffee, Water, softdrinks, beer etc on board, the planes are old, no Wi-Fi etc. Try Virgin America and you will the diference...
god hurtig troværdig ... Det var ingen problem med handler hos dem !
Tak for en super service med et super produkt til en superpris.
Fra nu af kommer jeg til at spare mange penge - thumbs up
the first time i bought products for bodybuilding was from gymnordic. i have never had a problem with delivery and from time to time the staff at gymnordic put a smile on my face, with a small gift for being a faithful customer. i strongly recommend to contact them in the case of late delivery (which I have never heard of) or other products than the ordered ones. they will reply you promptly and solve your problem. 5 stars for quality service, broad product range and friendly staff.
great customer service (though I do not speak very well danish); fast response; great deals for all sort of products; extremely fast delivery (if they have the product on stock). thank you for giving us the most out of skating. you're the best in DK.
I ordered a pocket camera at Sekvencia. It was a good price and free delivery. Everything seemed fine, and I got an order number by email. However, nothing happened. The order kept pending as "In progress". I called Sekvencia, as I hadn't heard anything from them (despite the fact that I wrote specifically in my order that Sekvencia were to contact me, if my order were to be shipped later than 2-3 days, as they promised online). I was then told over the phone that my package couldn't be delivered on time, even though it said 2-3 days online when I purchased the camera. The sales guy actually told me that the 2-3 days "just is a written mistake online". They apparently  never deliver things on time, as they themselves have them shipped from different places. Now - to be fair. The sales guy promised me to put an extra big memory card in the package AND that I would have it delivered the following Monday. That was what kept me from canceling the order straight away. After I spoke with the sales guy, I realized that Sekvencia had already drawn the money from my account. Even though they were not able to deliver my purchase. The package has still not turned up, and I have not heard anything back from Sekvencia. No phone call. No reply on my email. I would like Sekvencia to answer one simple question for me: When do I get, what I paid for? Until then - I must warn you: Don't buy anything from this company!
My coffee has to be perfect, and that means right down to the buying experience. Kaffekompagniet.com fits the bill, does the job, no messing around. Thats what I like, thats what I expect and Kaffekompagniet dosen't disapoint. There are enough other things to worry about, with a good cup of coffee in my hand just bring it on!!!
Absolutely nothing to complain about. The price is awesome and the shipping was fast...
Apple levered et super produkt og deres service er i top.
jeg er glad for callme of har skafet mange kunder til, den da jeg er ikke tilfreds med er at internet stopper mange gang..
Everything whent smooth from order till I had the goods :-)
I ordered a frame on 10-09-2012, and was promised 4-6 weeks delivery time. Today, on December 14, 13 weeks later, I have still not received it. I have asked the customer service several times when it will be delivered, and every time I'm told to wait just a little longer. The company does nothing to keep me up to date on my order status unless I ask them by email. When I look at their website, it still says that the frame can be delivered within 4-6 weeks. That's a lie. UPDATE: Yesterday 06-02-2013 I received another update from Edel-Optics. The frame will be delivered in a month or so. I have heard that six times before, and have decided to delete my order. I will tell everyone I know to avoid this scam. On Edel-Optics' website, it still says 4-6 weeks delivery time...!
very fast and quick service, everything has been easy. The glasses was packed very secure. and it was cheaper than other places...to good to be true...but it is true, especially when you love sunglasses!
My very first buy and it was a success. Delivered at my door according to my order. Very nice.
brought my macbook air in after water damage. It was cleaned and one part changed within a couple days. Got updates via phone on the process. great service, and can highly recommend these guys
Even though the home page and the "Controller"-application are not too user friendly, the product and the support so greatly compensate this, that I cannot go below 5 stars. If you own a Beo-link remote and non-B&O products you simply need the signal converter. Currently I have the IR-converter placed beneath my 50" plasma TV and have the B&O IR-receiver (shielded from plasma IR). This setup works like a charm and control of both TV and BluRay is a smooth as with the original remotes. Please bear in mind that the shielded IR-reiver is a requirement for use in plasma-TV-setups - no harm done though as this receiver is an original B&O product in EXCELLENT quality and finish (also sold by Lintronic)!
My order was sent off immediately and delivered to my door the next day, beautifully packed.  One could not wish for more and I will certainly continue to use Helsehelse.dk
No problem, and all in ordre and on time, 2 time i buy here :-) Happy customer
My family and i flew Copenhagen - Stockholm - Beijing - Manila. Compared with our last experience with Emirates, Air China was very disappointing. 1. Cabin staff speak bad english. Is even replying back in chinese 2. Cabin staff seems irritated and stressed. Is not smiling to the passengers 3. Bad serving of meals. Food and drinks are not served at the same time. Coordination is missing 4. From Copenhagen - Stockholm SAS is managing the flight for Air China. Old planes, dirty interior and unfriendly staff 5. It is not possible to make complete boarding card from Copenhagen - Manila. Bad service - the customers has to make even more check in - although all is booked through Air China Next time we will surely ask Emirates for an offer first.
Det er godt at handle hos dvdoo, de holder det de lover
der jeg start med dem var de billig, nu alt for dyr!
Don't pay for premium at their place, its simply not worth the payment at all. They have extremely low speeds for premium users, you can consider your self lucky if it comes above 100 kbps and then the downloading is so extremely unstable, that you will experience tons of failed downloads.
Obviously is their bank connection not the best. My Visa card that i never ever had problems with shopping online with within the EU countries was not accepted when trying to buy a couple of movies at their place. It was a complete waste of time with all that registry you had to go thrue first. Considering the tough security there are for Danes on our Visa cards, there its better for us just to shop within the EU region, where the banks have full knowledge on the tough security Danish Visa cards have and therefor have adjusted to it.
I can highly recommend their software. I use both their PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro. They are much easier to figure out and use, than other similar softwares i have tried over the years.
Java for your home computer can't be trusted at all. Hackers has been able to hack it for years, newest update is already being reported unsafe and then obviously there is a bug in it because i experience Java problems all over the place, where i never had any problems before. We have a logon system named NemID in Denmark. The problem is that its Java based and each time there are problems with Java, then the logon system does not work, which is a HUGE problem, because that system is used for online banking, taxes, retirement payments, unemployment offices and everything else you can think off that has to do with the government and payments. In short, i think Java sucks. There is nothing but problems each time some hacker discovers yet another security hole in that dinosaur software or when some programmer at Oracle does not do his job propperly.
Good service, fast. Price a bit higher then what you can get from UK but mainly due to different VAT and pund/crown value.
Thanks for at very good trade ! fast and cheap, I don`t bay games again, without having tjekked your price first.
You have a very nice service. I'll recommend this company to anyone
I got a pair of glasses and a pair sunglasses. I am really satisfied with both orders, the prices and the delivery time are unbeatable. I got the sunglasses withing 2 days and the 'normal' glasses within 4 days which is really fast if you consider that they need to make the lenses. I know that it might seem difficult to choose glasses online, but Lensway's virtual mirror works really well (if you enter your correct PD / pupilafstand!). The glasses fit just like they did on the virtual mirror. Highly recommendable!
I have ordered a 6kg packet, and it arrived within 2 days at my local post office !!! The delivery was super fast and the product as promised on the website, and delivered in good condition. All in all, I am a happy customer. Thank you.
Just shortly after charging DKK100 on my Vopium account in November 2010, I made a few calls, then the Vopium application crashed on my phone and I was unable to use it anymore. After contacting the service team several times, the technical problem has still not been resolved until now and it has been 3 1/2 months!!! The correspondence was very unsatisfying: I have contacted Vopium several times, and initially they have responded with apologies and promises to resolve the issue, however since December 2010 my emails and my technical problem were simply ignored! This leaves a sincerely unhappy customer! I will not use Vopium anymore in the future, and I would certainly not recommend Vopium to anybody.
This is the second time I have ordered vitamins and skin-care products at Jala-Helsekost and I am absolutely satisfied. The delivery is fast (2-3 days), the prices are very good and the payment was super easy. Thank you and keep on doing what you are doing!
Its not consulting but insulting in a fun and inspiring way - and your life will never be the same again.
- Overskuelig site - God pris - Hurtig levering - God information
Objekt 523981, Cefalù I have not superlatives enough for this amazing place. The hostess, Sara, welcomed as a family member in her beautiful house. Clean and properly with all modern amenities and with ample opportunities for both privacy and excursions. Sara showered like a fountain of useful information about the activity opportunities both locally and wonderful Sicily. Throughout the stay, she took care of our well-being and she left no one in doubt about anything. The house, with cozy corners and large bright room reeks of Sicilian comfort and family influenced décor and around gives terre and enabled both stunning views, sunbathing and space for relaxing in the shade. After the hostess friendly instructions were options open for beach excursions, shopping and visits to the area's attractions. This stay is difficult to forget and is definitely not the last. Consider these words of warmest recommendation, if you want high quality and a big thank you to Sarah. See you next year Mogens Bøgh, Svendborg, Denmark.
Very satisfied purchase. I bought many products there, dishwasher, radio clock, games, fridge etc. and all for a good price. Will purchase their again
I m happy with the service and prices. Would buy here again
Compared to salon-prices, i probably saved 50-75%, incredible! Very convenient to order, very fast delivery. I will definitely use your service again and will recommend it to others as well! I am a very happy and satisfied client!
All in all, good and efficient delivery. Yet I have experienced severe technical problems when ordering online - must be due to a good offer - 25% off online orders. The site was crashing a few times and very slow. I managed to order the items, they arrived in good time. I just wish delivery was for free, as other toys shops offer in Denmark.
If have purchased wine a lot of times and everythings work perfect
I order 2 pair of sunglasses. The day after my order i got a mail with track and trace number and 2 days later UPS was at my door with them. They where packed carefully so they would not break. So I would any time I need new sunglasses shop there again.
Pixmania...  what can i say To quote: Tina Turner You're simply the best, better than all the rest Fast delivery and god service
Kazi Networks has provided me with great service and support over the last 2 years. Highly recommended.

Will i by from this company again  ..... Yes I will I just bought 2 pairs of Maui Jim sunglasses, I received them a few days after they were ordered, when I contacted customer service I got the answer right away, that what i call great service, I can highly recommend this company
The way to do internet shopping: No problems at all
det er ikke sidste gang jeg handler her for alt var ok
Experience New York the New York Pass is vital for you. Good information before you arrive, easy to pick up the pass, the NYP book have a lot of information to plan your day and you save time at most attraction you want to visit because you have your own queue. It do not get the ranking 5 starts because I was not told that Ellis Island was closed and have been that for nearly one year. This information could have been very useful when we planned our daily attractions to visit. I also have to tell that the New Your Pass have raised the bar before arrival because we were informed very detailed about which attractions was closed because of the General Government Shutdown in the beginning of October 2013. Regards Preben Lauesen from Denmark.
Started with this company in order to collect their WWII vehicles series. After 1 month, I recieved my first model in a broken case. I immediately emailed them and told them about the problem, and they promised to send me a replacement. 5 months later, and I have not recieved that replacement... however I have been billed for 4 models that I never got. Emails to them go unanswered, but they keep sending bills. I will not pay one single cent to this company when they cannot deliver what they promise, especially when I am billed for something I have never recieved. I cannot possibly give a lower rating.
Delivery was fast and correct so I give Army Star my warmest recommendations.
I ordered frames in April with expected delivery date in 5-11 days. After 5 weeks (!) of waiting I wrote an email asking for the order status - turned out it was not even sent yet! They promised me 5-11 days again, apologized and offered 5% discount. I admit that the email was nice and convincing. BUT after two days I got exactly the same email, from a different person, who offered 10% discount. So apparently their customer support is confused as well and multiple people handle the same case. Anyway, I decided to wait again. It was in July that I finally asked for a full refund ( I received the money within a week, so at least this aspect is ok). I'm so disappointed with this company. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it's really not worth wasting your time.
I love this company. I ordered few times and never ever had any problems. Delivery is fast, prizes are wonderful Thank you
I buy new display , the delivery was mega fast. One day I buy it next day I got it:) Cool.... Nice company, great support  not cheapest but good quality products. Thank you

We order with bf new phones and The delivery was extremely fast. Next day I have the telephone at home. Great. One think I will like to change is the calling minutes. When you buy telephone+abonnement ,there is not option for free calling hours. I think will be nice to make some great  and not pay for every call minute.' When They change this -It will be such a wonderful !!!! :) Thank you Call me:)
I like to shop in Netto. In this few years they become much more better. The quality of the food is great and Finely you can find the expensive ecologic products much more cheaper.It is on of mine favorite shops . I do not really know the service but When i need return or help there was never any problems:)
All the time ,I fly home I use Norwegian company.I cant say anything bad . The prices are such a wonderful and is not so many company s on the market as this one .I hope they will keep price down and wish you good luck in business:) I will for sure fly with you more and more:)
well , Sadly I'm not happy for this company at all. I stay there for 4 years and The last year was the worst. Bad service, not helpful and price for sms to another country for 4 kr per  is crazy .  They will not make any deal at all to keep you as customer Time to change .....
jeg har købt en htc tattoo mega glad for den
super service - holder hvad de lover med hensyn til levering osv
I have been a customer at Netgroup for several years but I have now decided to quit using their services. Compared to Amazon EC2 the service is just too poor, when taking into consideration, that the Netgroup VM pricing is at least twice of Amazons. In conclusion my business will be consolidated with Amazon from here on. With the pricing in consideration the following customer service experience triggered the decision to leave. At Netgroup all bills are sent out manually and have to be paid manually. Recently by mistake we paid a small amount less than invoiced after an upgrade to our agreenment. Next bill had a fee added for the late payment of approx. 40$. Of course we also forgot to add the extras on that payment. Our mistake, but it is just way to rigid. I have been suggesting an automatic billing process to Netgroup for years, but nothing has happened.
They are all the same, good at taking your money then handle you like you are diseased.
jeg har købt mobil lg 540 har fået en god service hos call me
Bestilte dag 1 , film i postkasse dag 2 -- SÅDAN!
This company is rotten. I signed up, and that went really fast, but since then, and thats more than 4 months ago, ive heard nothing - no reply to my support tickets, no transfer of the domain i ordered. These guys are doing domain fraud i would say - i recommend to stay away from them. If there were ZERO stars to fill, i would do it no doubt.
ja både til mine maxier jeg laver og min monza og alt i alt er det bare top dollar :D keep up the good work
Im overall happy with the fast and good delivery from bestseller.I have ordered a few times now and I think its great how easy it is to shop from several labels at the same time. Only thing, I realised too late I should have sent the package to my work address (the day after but before it was shipped) so I would have liked to be able ti change the address at that point, not sure if that is an option.alternatively, a reminder when ordering would have been cool ('you are sure you want to send to home address?' Or the like) but it was then delivered by the post in the evening so that wasnt a problem. overall pleased with the experience.
it's so easy to order, look at the size of the table, click purchase and it comes after a few days. It can not be done better in with army-star.com
I have ordered from this website several times. They have an impressive selection of health products, including ones that are harder to find.
I was very happy with this company. My order arrived very quickly after I had placed it, and the items were carefully and meticulously wrapped and packaged into the box. The website was easy to navigate and the selection was satisfactory (but it would be nice if they had some of the more offbeat, non-vanilla toys). The items were good quality and the price was reasonable. I will be ordering from here again next time we need a new toy.
If you book through Ticket you will find out how easy it is - so just do that next time :-D
I used call me since 5 years, but last month they changed their rules, when they made calls to some countries more expensive than others.
This company overflows trustpilot with false positive reviews, mostly written in english. Go read the reviews in other languages and you'll see. They will take your money, and ignore your complaints. Stay away from them. I did not recieve my order, but they took my money.

Delivery took 9 days from the UK to Denmark, but when I opened the parcel, two 1000 ml bottles of shampoo and conditioner were missing. The box my order was shipped in was too small for them to ever have fit in there. Sloppiness or fraud? It was quite confusing to raise a claim regarding the missing items. My order was closed, as it was already delivered. I managed to get through to customers service on the phone, but I have to pay the phonebill myself. In order to have the missing items sent to me, I have to fill out a disclaimer, which must be filled out and signed in hand, not computer generated. So glad that I have a scanner that allow me to pass another obstacle in my struggle to make Lookfantastic deliver what I have already paid for. I have yet to see if the items - which accounts for half of the total I paid for the order - will ever be delivered. On this basis, I cannot recommend Lookfantastic to anybody.
I ordered a set of Bosch Wipers for my Peugeot 406 Coupe. My car has a rain sensor, which the provided wiper cannot clean, because the wiper is to short (450 mm as opposed to the standard wiper length of 475). When I asked whether the wiper was in error, the answer was: 'For the wiper to be refunded, you need to return it'. No desire to diagnose or fix the problem was detected. Nor were instructions provides on how to progress. When I asked whether they could ask Bosch, if the wiper was in error, the new answer was: 'As we have not heard of this problem before, answer is no!' Surely I will not use this dealer any more.
I can be sure that I will be using them again and again..
I have ordered broadband from YouSee. Everything went fine until suddenly it wend down after two months. I have called them: they could only send a technician after four (4!) days, only to tell me that I don't have internet because I do not have a TV subscription!. When we opened the subscription we were not informed that we NEED a TV subscription in order to have internet! The one that I have talked with over the phone could not figure out that the internet does not work because we have no TV-signal. Unbelievable! I have canceled my subscription! I think they expected me to pay an extra 200 for the TV as well, so I get to a total of 450? I would have had more respect if they would have informed me about it.
The order process was very smooth and the purchase delivered within 2-3 days, certainly much quicker than I had expected. Very good communication from "with prompt confirmation of order and dispatch". Thank you.
De holder hvad de lover og har en super god service!
I've had two e-mail accounts with forwarding premium service with MAIL.COM since beginning of 2002 (MAIL.COM is a company owned by United Internet AG). I've until now generally been happy about the service provided, however when I was notified about automatic extension for one of the accounts due 12 March 2012 by billing previously used credit card, I decided to cancel the premium service (USD 19,95) for this e-mail account and communicated my request twice to MAIL.COM 28 February 2012: 1. By on-line message to customer support as instructed in notification e-mail from MAIL.COM. 2. By e-mail sent from my subscription MAIL.COM e-mail account (requires my login information, e.g. password) as instructed in a e-mail from Premium support received as response to (1). Instead of sending me a cancellation confirmation MAIL.COM actually billed my credit card account 15 March 2012 despite my cancellation request. I've complained about this to MAIL.COM asking my money back and they've replied on 22 March 2012 that my "...case is being escalated to our administrators with the cancellation issue." Today 5 April 2012 I've still not received any further information or my money back. Hence for the time being I would like to warn customers about giving credit card information to MAIL.COM in order to subscribe to Premium service, as there in case of cancellation of Premium service seems to be a risk that they continue billing despite cancellation. Rest assured that should this case be solved to my satisfaction, I will return and update this review. 11 May 2012 update: ================ I've now received my USD 19,95 back. I received e-mail 19 April 2012 with apologies for delay and informing the contract had now been been cancelled and the invoice had as well been voided. Maybe to compensate for the trouble MAIL.COM has decided to let me keep the premium features for free the one year, I had unwillingly been billed for. The return payment was posted to my credit card account 05 May 2012. Thanks. And I've accordingly changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars.
very nice  products  fast deliver end  very god prices i am total recommended!

I got the printer that I ordered the same day I paid online for it.
they deliver fast and there is no problem whit the product. so it just 1 word to say "nice"
I waited 20 minutes on the phone for somebody to pickup from customer service. This is very irritating.
Hi all, I payed boligportal 365kr for 2 months usage and there are no interesting offers in Copenhagen. Also the site is not usable from mobile phone/iPad, most of times nothing happens when I try to use it from my phone. The apartments do not have images with interior and most of times the people behind the ads do not answer e-mail. And they do not leave a phone number. So I will never use this one again...
We were at Jysk Sorø to buy a new cupboard for home. We were like close to the closing hour, but we were on the cashier and were preparing to pay when the girl at the cash desk said: "can't you hurry up I have to go home" I hate this in Denmark every employee doesn't care about the service they are part of, it makes all of those services in Denmark pretty unreliable. I hate lazy people!

I ordered from the webshop. Got a phonecall the next day. Was asked i it was urgent. It was. The computer was down and help on the way. Offered to do manual work to fulfill my order. Called later that the computer was running again. Delivered my order at the postoffice same day - got my stuff the nexy day. Nice
I been using OnlineKeyStore for around 1-2 years and i never been led down, the keys come within 2 hours, if you got any problems the online support is great and if you get an invaild key they will give you a new one or refund you're money back in their own points for then to spend on other games or save them at the end OnlineKeyStore is a great place for people who are looking for cheap keys.
there could be a little more information about the selection of lenses, and what type there would be most suitable for certain needs. but other than that- good website
Kan trygt handle hos helm de er hurtige til at levere
I've now ordered with av-cables on at least 4 separate occasions. Delivery is always really fast (last order was delivered the following morning). Easily my go-to place to get spare cables online!
We have now placed orders with Nemlig.com almost 20 times. Delivery is always within the agreed upon period. Products are never missing. Shopping experience, both online and through the Nemlig App is fantastic and smooth. Extra customer centric features (like Top 100, recipes, etc.) are excellent and add value to the experience. The only minor downside is that a few specific items are not sold by Nemlig and that occasionally there are "sold" out goods when Nemlig has discount on these. However, that is absolutely a non-issue considering the unprecedented level of customer service and reliable deliveries that Nemlig has. Outstanding!
I really wanted to like Petworld.dk and have it as the primary source of all shopping for our cats. Sadly, I don't think this will happen. Here's why: Thursday 16th of May I have attempted to complete a purchase on the site. I have spent a rather long time picking out a total of almost 20 different items to purchase. I ran into a few minor issues while trying to place the order and fill out the info (page was constantly refreshing and erasing my data). Finally I was able to get to the payment page, entered my credit card details, clicked "Pay"...and was presented with the following error (actual order and payment numbers are replaced with "XXXXX": An Error Occured We were unable to display the page, please contact Petworld. Your order number is: XXXXXXXX And your payment identification number is: XXXXXX Contact email: web@petworld.dk Contact phone: 76 90 80 00 Fine. These things happen. I immediately wrote an email to web@petworld.dk, where I asked whether the payment has gone through and whether my registration with Club Petworld (filled out in parallel with the purchase) went through. Friday 17th of May: I have received an email from Petworld, stating that they cannot find any of my information in the system, all they know is that an error occurred. They asked me to place my order again. OK. I spent another half hour filling out the order basket, from memory (my basket was not saved). Finally I was done and the purchase went through this time. However, it appeared that my Club Petworld registration did not go through and I did not get the 4% bonus for my purchase. I immediately wrote another email to customer support explaining the problem. I was told that the bonus will probably be added only after the order has been packed and shipped, and that I was not to worry - they would add the bonus on Tuesday the 21st, manually, if it didn't go through. Tuesday 21st: I received a confirmation that my order was finally shipped. My bonus was still missing. Since I didn't hear anything from customer support I contacted them again by myself. I was told that apparently I had two accounts in their system (probably something to do with my original failed error order), but no worries - they would merge my accounts and give me my bonus. Later that same day I received an automated email that a third Club Petworld account was created in my name. Again I reached out to customer service to ask what was happening. Instead of giving me a clear answer I was asked whether MY computer was secure, updated, etc., implying that maybe I'm the one causing the issues. Wednesday 22nd of May: We received our order, but one of the items from the order was missing. Moreover, my 4% bonus was still not updated and I didn't hear any news from customer service. I wrote a frustrated email to customer service, stating that an item was missing from the order and that I wasn't given the bonus. 23rd of May: I received an apologetic email from customer service, stating that they would ship the missing item to me that day. Also, they would definitely fix my Club Petworld bonus issue, but the only person who could do it would only be there on Friday the 24th. I was also told that the "bright side" was that my case was helping Petworld.dk improve their systems. That's great to hear. Friday the 24th: Nothing happened. No emails from customer service with any updates. No bonus. Today is the 27th of May, and I can state the following: The missing item from the first order has STILL not arrived. The 4% Club Petworld bonus is STILL not assigned to my account. I am done trying to contact customer service. Throughout this whole ordeal I was the one constantly probing and sending emails. Not ONCE did customer service proactively write me an email to update me on the status and let me know what was being done. The 4% bonus is not really the issue - it's less than 50 dkk we are talking about. The issue lies in continued errors, slow delivery and an unresponsive customer service. I'm sorry, but in 2013 I would expect better. Petworld.dk - please shape up, then maybe we can be friends again!
I especially like the accompanying "return" sheet, in case I need to send the watch back for any reason. Very customer centric.
They sent a mail a week ago where it said Expected By and then an empty field. Since then I havent heard or recieved anything. Now I have to go out and buy my product elsewhere cause my dog can't wait anylonger for the treatment. Don't order from this place if you need good service. Im still waiting to see if im even gonna recieve what i ordered.
Have made about ten plus, orders from this site, and I have always been happy, and have had only good experriences with customerservice when needed.
Expected delivery time was estimated to 1-3 days and it ended up taking 7, granted I ordered in a Wednesday so there was a weekend in betwean.. but the order wasent sendt until the end of workday on the next Monday. (everything I ordered was in storage and plenty such). Aditionally the order consisted of 4 packages / tracking numbers, 1 of which I did not recieve and their support was not able to tell me what the missing one consisted of other then a vague guess that it was the insurance papers. (3 days later I still havent recieved those). Other then that, fair prices, quick support both pr. phone and mail.
Have purchased a number of iPADs, which has been delivered very quickly with excellent quality
Jeg brugte den franske Opodo, men så vidt jeg kan se fra Trustpilot review og andre kommentarer på nettet, er det same svindel koncept de bruger I alle landene. Så her har I den engelske version af vores oplevelser. Before I bought our airline tickets Marseilles-Istanbul-Bangkok and back, I checked prices with Opodo and a couple of other agencies. The prices were pretty much the same but as I had been told that Opodo was a big travel agency with offices in many countries, I decided to buy thru them. What a mistake…… Before I bought the tickets, I managed to get thru to a lady on their phone number – with a lot of patience. I wanted to know whether I could reserve our seats when I bought the tickets.  I was told that I could do that thru their “service après vente” that I would get access to after buying the tickets. So I bought the tickets. I received immediately an e-mail confirmation. In that e-mail I was told that I would receive an e-mail with details about the e-tickets within 48 hours. The also said that I had to check my SPAM mail as the e-mail risked to end up here. That was the 27th of April 2013. So far I have received nothing – and I have been examining my SPAM. I have contacted them 10 times with questions about e-tickets, seat reservation and a couple of other thing using their official contact form. I have never received an answer. But I have a copy of text, date and time of every contact form sent. I have sent a letter to the English European Headquarter with a copy to Opodo in Bordeaux – recommended. I have received the delivery confirmation – but no answer. I my recommended letter and the last contact form I stated, that I had completely lost confidence in Opodo, and as they refused to answer to any questions I demanded that the cancelled my command and reimbursed my money – which was, of course, lifted from my account the day I ordered the tickets. No reply, no money reimbursed. What do you call such a company? I know the name I would use. My advice to you: never ever use Opodo.
Det var en god oplevelse at handle hos jer , alt uden problemer
Det bedste er at de er til at tale med og altid er klar til at svare.
I have rented cars from Auto Europe in DK, AT, DE and IT and have always been treated well. Last time my airline changed their route plan for Milan and i would arrive 8 hours before intended when I booked my car. This I couldn't change without costs, how ever Auto Europe was good as showing understanding and found a similar offer with another company when Hertz would support the change of time for the rental.
Alt i alt en ok handel, men leveringstiden var for lang.
An excellent and precise handling of any order. There is no shit, just pure plesure, at any order.
A good place to shop despite high prices and discount rate not sensational .. The tracking and trace information about the shipping is quite poor and messy!!! The carrier informed and came by the very same day.. Unfortunately, I was not home that day. So he come back the day after at noon while I was at work!?! I had to go home to pick up my parcel ...
I lost my 3G connection for some months and no compensation though I paid for it. Also they were supposed to send me a new contract better suited to my consumption habits but it never came....instead I received a new offer?!?
They managed to deliver the order on time despite a late order during Christmas. Though the item was on stock, they delivered the item to another delivery address just a few days after. As a suggestion, I just think they might improve the order tracking information system which is quite poor or at least not so informative. Alternatives: www.interlinkexpress.com or www.chronopost.fr
jeg er tilfreds med den hurtig levering i har ...
RS Components is incredibly frustrating to deal with. When executing orders they are exceptionally good, and extremely professional. RS Components for me used to be a five star supplier that I would always place orders with in normal circumstances. Approximately 18 months ago however the buying experience changed radically when RS Components changed one of the most functional websites, that was always an exceptional inspiration for solutions to a visually pretty site where you waste your time and can spend hours looking for the simplest things. They have lately added a chat function with some employees where some have a very poor attitude. While I would love to place more orders with the company I find that the customer interaction has gone from a 4-5 star rating to a 1 star rating. Wasting time and not being able to find solutions undermines the whole RS experience. I don't know if all the advertising on the site is paid for and thus a revenue stream for RS, but as a supplier they have gone from probably my preferred supplier to one that gets a lot less business - solely because of the most irritating website you can imagine.
5-STARS! And if it were possible to give more STARS, i would do so. I took my humidity damaged Huawei phone to the Vesterport Station store and the very excellent Emil fixed my phone within 1 hour: Very helpful + very precise + very fast. Prior to this ‘problem solved’ repair at mobilreparationer.dk today, I had my phone sitting in the El Giganten Repair Shop (N’brogade) for over 1 month for the same problem, and they did NOT fix it. So, 1 month of time uttelrly wasted at El Giganten was thankfully remedied by 1 hour with total solution and total service at mobilreparationer.dk. I’ll gladly use mobilreparationer.dk again , and I warmly recommend them to all if you have humidity or water damage in your mobile phone. On the whole, great service + very conveniently located.
the 'value for money' of CBB is tops: 5 out of 5 stars. the actual connection itself is 5 stars as well: the network has verarel gone sown or slowed, and when it does CBB is fair to make notices. the customer service in terms of problem-solving + courtesy is 4-stars. the actula speed of the customer service can vary between 3-4 stars.  getting through to CBB on their customer support phone line can take eons on some days-- but once through the CBB staff have always been mega helpful + fast acting. lastly, getting help/reply via email varies a good deal as well: it's hit or miss. but on the whole, 4 stars to CBB for for 4 very satisfied years as CBB customer. Highly Recommended.
I have been to Baan Joy numerous times and always have the same experience. Great, authentic Thai food, woeful service. Yesterday was particularly bad, hence why I am writing about it.  Our entrees didn't arrive before our mains.  We finished our mains and went to pay to be told our entrees were ready.  We said something a long the lines of 'but we have finished our meal - they were supposed to be entrees' to be told that 'we have to make them fresh every time'.  So we were forced to pay for the entrees and take them away with us, only to get home and realise we'd been given the wrong entrees - something I am actually allergic to.  Great. This is not the only time we have received bad service at Baan Joy.  On other occasions it has been careless (sometimes bordering on rude) and slow.
Danni did the hair for my wedding: for myself, my mum and my sister.  He is clearly a talented hairdresser, but he took a rather relaxed approach to it all...  In the end, I was very happy with the result, but I wonder whether he could have put a little more emphasis on customer service :)
Maria did the make-up for my wedding: for myself, my mum and sister.  She did a great job with it and was a pleasure to deal with.  I would definitely recommend her to others looking for a professional, at home service.
I bought a skirt from Kirstenkbh and received the package in 2 days.  It was packed in a cute way and came with a sweet thank you note from Kia.  I would definitely purchase there again...
My boyfriend and I chose to buy my engagement ring through Hartmanns and I have to say we are both very happy with the final product.  The ring is exactly what we were hoping for - different, but understated - with both the diamond and design being of high quality... However, the service we experienced at Hartmanns was some of the worse we have experienced anywhere!  From months of delays with no communication, to missed appointments, to ordering wedding bands we hadn't decided on...  Although we really wanted to buy our wedding bands at Hartmanns, since we love my engagement ring so much, in the end we decided we could not give Hartmanns any more business after being treated so badly.  It was a real shame, because they really do have some nice pieces.
We had our wedding at Mielcke & Hurtigkarl in May and were actually blown away with how good a job Jan and his staff did...  I know everyone always thinks highly of their own wedding, but a number of our guests also commented that it was the best wedding they had ever been to. Jan organised everything perfectly, from the food (and matched wines), to the table settings and DJ.  His staff went above and beyond - babysitting a guest's baby in the kitchen while we danced the night away and opening up on Sunday morning so we could pick up our presents before leaving for our honeymoon.  They were all really a pleasure to deal with. I would absolutely recommend Mielcke & Hurtigkarl for a nice night out or a special event.
Stasia made my wedding dress and did a fantastic job!  Unlike many of the other providers I contacted initially, she was communicative and proactive.  She helped me refine the design I initially came up with, so it was something special, that suited both me and the occasion very well...  She was able to work around my schedule for all the fittings, as I don't live in Copenhagen. The dress was quite expensive, but no more than the other dresses I tried on which were not custom made nor of as high quality.  Overall, I think it was very good value when you consider the amount of work that went into it and the quality of the fabrics and design. I would definitely recommend Stasia to friends.
Malene did the flowers for our wedding in May 2013.  She did a great job with the arrangements (combining Danish spring wildflowers, with Australian eucalyptus).  She was a pleasure to deal with and her pricing was very fair for the quality of what she delivered. I would recommend Malene to friends without reservation.
i brought a camera from you for recording, and i can not even set it for the recording and when i sent you an e-mail to help out, you were not able to explain. from me, not ok

Additional update: Until otherwise convinced, my view is that match2web.dk or another body is in the process of trying to resell my domain hvolby.net without my acceptance. 1) The administration of the domain was transferred from buydomains.dk to match2web.com late January 2011 without my consent. 2) match2web.com changed my master DNS setting to point to another server than it was pointing at previously. 3) On the "new" and totally unacceptable page they ask you to bid for MY domain at a starting price of USD 69. Lessons learned: Print and store ALL your invoices and communication with your provider.  You never know when you need it to prove your case. Regards, Eric Hvolby ------------------ Original posting: I had my domain registered through Buydomains. Now the responsiblity is at match2web.com Match2web.com has now changed my DNS settings to rubbish. It has simply been impossible to get Match2web.com to change my DNS settings to the original settings or transfer it to a professional provider like servage.net. I highy recommend NOT to do business with Match2web.com. I can be contacted at cdn1@hvolby.eu Regards, Eric Hvolby
I have ordered lots of movies and video games for shipping to Denmark. The prices are lower than over here and the shipping is free. I have never recieved a defective product, and if the price falls they automatically lower the price for you. Only thing missing is a filter, that shows whether or not a product is available for international shipping. I have tried several times to order products from other departments only to be rejected at the very end of my ordering proces. As a result I only shop in the movie and video games sections.
I will strongly advice businesses not to use this courrier-service. From my experience they are lazy and unorganized. They called me on the day the delivery was surpossed to happen. They asked if I would be home to accept the delivery and I told them that I would be home all day. He additionally added, that there may be some custom fees upon delivery. I was told by the guy on the phone that they aren't too keen about payment with creditcards, and prefered if I had cash ready, eventhough they do accept creditcards, or atleast that's what he said. Later that day I noticed the DHL wan outside. I was about to go to the door, when I noticed that he got out of the wan and took a few steps to the mailbox and slipped in a note. I went down there, but too late to catch him. The note stated that a delivery-attempt had been made, but no one was home at the time of delivery. The road where I live is has a dead end, so I was awaiting the courriers return, because he has to pass my property, before he can leave the area. I was standing by the side of the road and waving the note I had just gotten. He drove right past me and I had to chase him on foot. 100 meters down the road there is a T-section, so he had to stop. I went in front of the wan and showed him the note. He came out and I asked him why he didn't stop, he replied "I didn't see you.". He gave me the package, and I asked about the customs fees, and he said "There are none". Now exactly three months laters, I got a letter from DHL with a bill for the custom fees on the delivery they made. Three months laster! I'm not even sure if this is legally allowed in Denmark... In short: Poor service Poorly organized Rude personel Misconduct Absolutely not recommended!
Det funk'er bare for Coolshop.dk - keep up the good work!
I have ordered a SUP board from kingofwatersports March 21th, and have still not received it more then a month later. The communication have been close to none existing, so now I've decided to cancel my order and asked to get a refund. I hope other people ordering from kingofwatersports will have a better experience then me.

Bought a replacement Garmin Ant+ heart rate belt, which was delivered the next day. Website is logically layed out which helps a lot when surfing for heart rate monitors and spares. Prices seems reasonable, and postage the usual Danish rates :-( All and all a very good experience, and will shop here in future for a new Garmin product
Lower or equally low prices as other internetshops. Great choice in high-end components, but one may wish for more lower to mid-end components to choose from. Fast shipping (when they are not moving to a new location). A history of previous orders would be nice to have available when logged in.
We have ordered neopren bibs that are simply the best. They are soft but firm, beautiful colors and patterns, food easily falls straight to the pocket. Our girl is 6 months old and size S is just what we need. The bibs are easy to clean and they dry fast. I think i will be giving it as a present to all moms and dads! And delivery was fantastically fast. Basically next day we got them at home.
Very quick service reasonable pricing i got what i ordered

I board a pair of K2 inlineskates. Value 200 euro. First the company send me the wrong size. They do not want to pay for the return , but offer to send some goods with the new skates to compensate for the mailingcosts. When I recieve the new skates, they are broke in the closeing mechanism. And the goods they were to send me are not delivered. According to return policy, they have to refund my mailing costs, but they refuse. I now have the European Consumer Center taking over the care. DON'T EVER BUY stuff at that site.
In few days ago , i bought i laptop from Merlin.dk i never had a good experience like this , they sent my laptop 1 day after booking , I got Email from merlin that they included trace number for post , so i had no worries ! laptop packing was good cause they put main pack in another package to prevent from any damage ! How ever just i had a problem when i wanted buy online , unfortunately Merlin.dk has no option for English language , I hope they add this option into the Merlin.dk .
Placed an order the 17 january and already on the 21 january I got the brush. We/my daughter love the brush and now she wants to get her hair brushed :)
Good prices! Fast delivery Personalized orders are possible A few times I have been returning things, but never had any problems with that.
The BitCoin Nordic webpages was easy to understand, and I felt it helpfull as a first time user. The actual transfer was quick - within a minute. I tried out the suggested wallet method in BitCoinNordic on Windows PC and Android with an electrum wallet. Getting Electrum on Android is NOT an easy thing and requires scripts outside Googleplay - this has nothing do with BitCoin Nordic - just the wallet method.
I have tried to contact Filehippo via the contact form at http://filehippo.com/info/contact/ and via their page on Facebook but I got no respnse. If it is because the contact form does not work you should get it fixed or add your email address on the page instead. Feature requests: If you have removed the browser that you have set in Settings > Results > Open results in Custom Browser Filehippo Update Checker does not respond at all. Is it possible to make Filehippo Update Checker show an alert saying that you have removed your custom browser if so ? I use the danish version of Mozilla Firefox but when I update the browser via Filehippo Update Checker it downloads the english version. Is it possible to make Filehippo Update Checker download the right language version?
The service in this shop is OUTSTANDING. They were so friendly when I called them on the phone to ask questions about a pair of sneakers. I got my shoes on the next day and felt that is was much easier to shop here than to go to town and by them there. Thank you all at Shoesandfriends! I will be back soon...
I'm happy with what I bought and thought the ordering system worked well. I was surprised though how long it took for the goods to arrive (over a week!), even with everything starting in France. I buy a lot of goods on the net and can't remember such slow delivery. When I buy clothes from GAP or Banana Republic in the UK, it's usually delivered to DK within 48 hours, more often than not 'free of charge'. The time it takes you to get the goods I've bought to me in DK will certainly have an influence on whether I use Spartoo again in the future.
great service above average, rely comfortable. Among my best flight experiences as an trawler guide.
Fik mine ting til tiden, det var bare super at handle her
I received my coat only 2 days after ordering beautifully wrapped. Something nice for me and it made an otherwise grey thursday much more sunny
The Torch is fine, give a really bright light and much more than expectet for such a small device. Getting hot after short while. My guess is that its eat battery fast but don´t know yet. I was surpriced to recive a invoice from UPS for more than 20€ for the delivering of the package, from Hungary to Denmark. I did not see that Price anywhere and would not bought the torch if I knew that. It ended to be the most expensive light I ever bought. I just saw on the homepage that they promise free shipping all over the World, so they should have only on start as they direct lie.......
It's quick and easy to change number to oister online. Everything is well explained, and one can change a lot online on oister.dk .
Vi var en tur til Garda i Italien. Alt klappede til UG.
I'm an international customer living en Denmark. I have been buying and returning merchandise from shops in Germany several times without any problems. The initial delivery of the ordered Goal keeper gloves went ok. A bit slow but thats due to DHL. I needed an exchange due to wrong size and have returned the gloves. It has now been 2 weeks - and I have heard nothing, and they are not responding on mails. I can only warn people against shopping at this company.
jeg er fuldt ud tilfreds med den service de har leveret
alt bestilt var med - alt fungerer - og levering fra dag til dag
When you have money they try to sell you stuff and lend you money. If you for some reason go through hardships, they strip you from what you have, and no matter how much you cry for mercy, they cut your heart and throw you in the street.  How you get up again is up to you. Nordea will not give you a hand. When you are finally up again, Nordea is more aggressive than ever taking everything you have,  once again,  and making your fight for survival a hell on earth. Someone that lost everything thanks to Nordea in Vanløse.
I got what I paid for and in the shortest possible time. These guys really work well.
I am very satisfied with both the reliable internet and phone connection I received from M1. The coverage could be better at the coasts(EDGE only) in North Juttland, but anyway it is perfect for my needs. Ah yes. And the price is excellent.
After looong search on the net and crazy delivery prices from UK , i finally found a nice purple hair color dye! The guys from Magicworld were fantastic- got fast delivery in reasonable price. All was nicely packed. I will for sure use Magicworld again! Thank you guys!

I can definitely recommend Lenson to every one who are looking for high quality contact lenses at a very good price.
I never received the perfume I bought. The money was transfered in the end of August, and after af couple of weeks I started to get worried. The company didn't respond to my e-mails for a long time, and when they finally did, they told me the package was on its way. It never came, and afterwards they stopped replying to my refund request. I have now contacted my bank and the local police after having sent 8-10 e-mails to Perfume4u.co.uk in the last 1½ months with no answer to my request for a total refund. Scam site - no doubt! Don't buy from this site...! UPDATE; The company has complained to Trustpilot and claimed my review to be dishonest (quite ironic!) to get it removed from Trustpilot. It was very easy to verify my "purchase" and prove my honesty. I guess Perfume4U most have hoped I had deleted the evidence... Even more reason now not to ever use this company.
If you wish to shop on the internet, then I can recomend SAXO. They got loads of books in english and ofcourse in danish, I have some of my books there and found them cheaper than elsewhere.
I can recommend 100% to anyone who wants a loan
First: Bought a bag and received it a week after I order it. The problem is that the store don't tell here it is placed. I received a letter from Custum that told me that I had received a package from China and that I had to pay taxes. If I had known that the package was sent from outside EU I would never have bought it. Second: There is no e-mail adress just a form if you want to contact the store. Third: I don't belive that the bags are real Mulburry's but just fine copies.
Overraskende god service i forhold til hvad jeg er vant til i fysiske butikker.
Har kun haft en god oplevelse med at handle hos jer
Fin name it flyverdragt, pris god i forhold til kvalitet,hurtig levering
Just bought a kitchen machine as a Christmas present. Ordered it 2 days before the need date and got it in time. Pretty good in late December.
We had to return a jacket, and there were no problems at all. Thanks.
Det har været en god oplevelse med at handle hos Gucca
As the way l am using my telephone, l have what l need.
The usermanuals are almost useless - the drawings show a antenna - but i'm still don't know if i need one.
Travelmarket makes it possibel for me to have a good search for lots of destinations.
jeg er glad for at i har en hurtig levering.
Just found 2 items on yoox.it I wanted to buy, but no no no not so simple. I get informed that they have one site for each country, so I have to go to yoox.dk for Denmark as they ship only to the country linked to the site. Here starts the challenge as yoox.dk has not exactly the same items. The items here are clearly more old, and the ones that are similar are min 30 % more expensive. The 2 itmes I wanted are not listed on the danish version, so I contact the socalled custormerservice, asking if they could ship theese 2 t.shirts to Denmark or list them on the danish site. No no no - they send me standard answer - clearly no one read my question or bothered to solve the matter. I tried few times more with same result. So to my knowledge YOOX.COM is a big waste of time.
A great way to experience Copenhagen, like a "sampler" at a restaurant...! Nice food and beverages, some history, some tourist sights, all arranged as a nice walk through parts of central Copenhagen. Colorful and knowledgeable guide who gave us a professional as well as personal view of the Danes and a good introduction to Danish (food) culture. Great way to spend half a day in Copenhagen, for tourists as well as for the natives... ;-)
I want to know, why I'm paying so much to this shit company! Should I report Telia again to EU Commission? I hope they will pay a lot of punishment those thief!
I've now bought 3 prints from Luke and i have to say that i'm more than pleased with the service i've been getting every single time. If i have any questions they are very quick to give feedback. The quality of the prints are absolutely superb and i've been more than satisfied every single time. If i have to put a finger on something it has to be that the international delivery time is 14-28 days which is a bit long but it's all worth it when your package arrives.
On a trip from Copenhagen to Lyon over Frankfurt The trip start with a 15 min delay from Copenhagen, due to late arrival from previous destination in Frankfurt, they park the plane some 12 minutes bus trip to the terminal, which leaves 18 min to change plane. As usual, the plane are not on time, and the connecting flight is not even arrived to Frankfurt. We end with almost 40 minutes in Frankfurt, even they now had almost the same amount of time between planes in Frankfurt as planned, and they manage to mislay many suitcases, which create a chaos in Lyon airport when 10% of the plane do not get their suitcase. And to make it all the better, the baggage tracking system in Lyon is down, so they can’t make an electronic ticket which mean you don’t get a luggage id you can trace, after just over 6 hours later the suitcases arrive at the hotel. On the return trip, they start with a 45 minutes delay from Lyon, due to late departure from Frankfurt. Which mean with bus transfer we arrive at the terminal at Frankfurt 12 minutes after the connection flight to Copenhagen has left the airport. They have automatic rebooked us to, no not the next plane 1 hour later, but a plane 3 hours and 35 minutes later. We now have to wait in queue for 30 minutes at the service center to get new boarding cards and meal ticket, but not automatically, we have to arguing with them about the laws in EU concerning air transport for another 12 minutes, then we get the meal vouchers. Afterwards we try to get in contact with Lufthansa get the 250 € per person back due to more than 3 hours delayed arrival at end destination, it is impossible. They do not reply on mails and you can only call them, to reserve a ticket not to complain. If just the same people handling complains was handling reservation we would not I a million years have used Lufthansa at the first place.
I signed up for this a long time ago, when I simply wanted to check it out. When I finally decided that I was tired of deleting uninteresting e-mails, I went on the site to delete my account. It told me that the deletion would be sent to the technical staff for processing. No longer than 20 minutes later, I received yet another mail, and that day I totaled another three from them, none regarding my deletion. When I tried to log in again to make sure that it was deleted, my account information could not be found. The result is that I have no user, but they are still sending me e-mails. I tried writing them using their support tool, but I have yet to receive an answer: But I've got plenty of mails from them.
Everything went a 100 procent smooth and professional. I received thorough advices from the very start to the end, so overall a very satisfying experience. I will without doubt use this company again!
I am satisfied with the product and the good service.
Det er blevet for dyrt at handle i super bedst i forhold til kvalliteten
Alt blev leveret som aftalt - regn dog med en ekstra dag i levering - men OK
Dag til dag levering med en vare som den ska være.
I have bought lots of things by dailydeal.de and I havent ever had problems. Thanks for the amazing things and offers!
I´m very happy whit CBB because they take care of the costumers and they have very good prices for the service they offer.
I placed an order  1503197596 for different products including 6 pcs Delonghi SER 3017 ECAM Wasserfilter, Article number:HV61DS17DE.  When the package arrived they had packed the wrong filters and instead I received DLS C002. I mailed customerservice 10. of January 2014 to ask them what to do. I haven't heard from them yet. Last week I decided to send back the wrong filters, but I still haven't heard anything from Hardwareversand.de. I still expect to receive 6 SER 3017 filters, because otherwise I have paid 47,63 € for 6 filters not according to my order and the orderconfirmation. Very bad customer service....
Not usually a store I'd go to, only Army Star stocked a particular item I needed, so I was *forced* into buying an item from them. However, the experience was indeed positive: It was easy to pick size directly from the catalogue (instead of e.g. adding the size as a note for ordering), and both ordering and payment was smooth. The item was shipped fast, delivery was as promised, and no excessive spamming afterwards!
They cheat. The money is deducted from your account the day traded with them. They did not reply to emails. The item you have ordered are never sent
Det er en god oplevelse at handle med dette firma
de har en god service og de ved alt om det i har og prisen er ok
super søgemaskine, og deres web browser er bare i top
After arrivering in Bergamo airport we found the Europcar office and the gave us the car an hour earlier than we booked it from (had made room for delays in my booking to avoid possible fees). They offered a extra insurance which I kindly refused and that was okay for them - no moaning or what so ever. The car where as expected and have only been driven 10.000 km. It worked as it should so no problems there. I left on the street in front of the Termini (central train station in Rome) and gave the key to man in the office there where I only had to sign for full tank and no damage to car. Both in Bergamo and in Rome it went very smoothly and quick. Will defintly do it agian!
I ordered a Konica Minolta colour laserprinter and received a HP black/white inkjet printer. Unkind support at Pixmania.dk. Then you have to print out (!) and fill out several papers and return the package to France where they must investigate whether it is right that it is wrong! But now I have received the Konica, 16 days after ordering.
Det var en super ting at handle hos jer alt funker 100 %.
I'm a freqent customer with Philipson, and I never experienced any faults or missing deliveries. Philipson is a good and trustworthy wine merchant - but here, as anywhere - you have to use your own judgement to find really good bargains. The "before" prices maybe sometimes seem a bit too optimistic. But anyway, the wine always meets your expectations
God service! God kvalitet! Alt i alt et super internet outlet for kvalitetsvin!
I have been a customer of One.com since 2008 and are extremely happy. I have often had questions for their support and they answer after a few hours. I've tried several different host, and One.com is clearly the best!
I really like it!! Its worth to find your true love on!!
I bought 2 rings, as I'm going to make my own ring sling. The item was shipped promptly and arrived the day after. Will definitely use this site again.
Overført Taletid hos Telmore er en god ting som jeg er glad for, at de har indført.
I wanted to buy a box of wine to top up my wine cabinet and I found many great temptations at philipsonwine.com.  They have many good offers and a large selection from many places of the world to choose from.  I had to take out a few minutes to make my decision - found it a bit hard to buy only one box of wine!  Delivery came as I specifically asked for!
A month ago I ordered dr.Martins shoes from the danish section of this company 800 d.kr..They confirm my order. 4 days later they cashed the money from my account. I haven`t got any shoes yet but several mails from the EU-company. Referring to the mail:"Please accept my sincerest apologies for the delay with your refund. Unfortunately our accounts team has informed us that due to an unexpected technical problem with the system we would use to refund your order, we are experiencing further delays processing your refund". The mail is anonymous. Don`t ever order anything from this company - they are cheating you With regards - Erling Bernhoff, Denmark
I placed an order and in same moment or half hour later I cancelled my order as I had an opportunity to get the "Amazon Kindle Fire HD" from another place (channel) which I unfortunately did not knew before ordering. I have contacted them 4 times since I placed the order on the 19th of May 2013 and they have only responded back once that they have placed my order on hold however they have already withdrawn the money from my bank account on the 23rd og may 2013. I have researched a bit on the company and they are not related to Skype as they write on their website and I also see that many others have had very bad experiences with the company so this is the reason for calling them a fraud company because they misuse the good name of Skype. Now I have contacted my bank to create a opposition against them as it is illegal to withdraw the Money before sending the goods. They will properly write me that they have been very busy and that the apologize now...let's see.
Det var super med den lykkepiller yumyum, men alt for mange med kylling..
Great internet connection, but you have to buy an extra service to get an external IP. You need this external IP if you want to work on a VPN from home, or if you wish to host a FTP server, so just be aware.
Det er en af grundene til at jeg handler hos Hair247
Since the owners have changed and support is not the same anymore!
Det var dag til dag levering , så det var super fedt !
ja hvad kan man sige mere end google er din ven
I have bought café Mimi cappuccino Brown (or chocoltate or something, I'm not sure of the name :p )  and I love them :) they are very comfy, and I must say I have no complains at all. I might have chosen too big ones for my eyes, but I'm going to buy smaller ones, like Bella brown, I'm waiting for it to come in the mail :) I'm very excited :D thank you pinky paradise :)
ordered online within mins got my order number, recived the item next morning what more could you want.
I love Skrill, it is so easy to withdraw and deposit money from bookmakers :-). It is free, and always go super fast! And when you need to withdraw some money to your bank account, it´s really cheap (about 2 dollars). Their point system is also really nice! Just bought a PS4 Mega Pack for my points I have saved up for a couple of months now :-). I would clearly recommend everyone that is betting online to use Skrill! It is the best for sure!
Første gang var jeg glad for at handle med jer - og, nu det samme.

My previous Philips Coffee Maker was showing signs of age, but at the same time I loved this machine. I did a search and much to my surprise Elgiganten had it in stock and at a very reasonable price. Within two days there it was in my kitchen making me a fine  cup of coffee just as I was used to. Fine service indeed.
I placed an order at JPC.de which included the purchace of 3 24 Karat GOLD CD's! Those 24 Karat Gold CD’s are special collectible items with a high price, hence they should be delivered and treated accordingly by JPC when JPC are shipping purchased items. Unfortunately this is not the case here!!!!!!! The shipped the purchased 24 Karat Gold CD's in an EXTREME poor packaging, resulting in one of these CD's got scratches on the front-cover including the sealing! I forwarded a complaint to JPC.de with full photos of the problem and included a solutution as well. This complaint can be reviewed here: https://app.box.com/s/g8zie5pnjpa7dwg8rtea Unfortunately JPC.de wont admit what they have done, and they asked me to return the faulty item. I then told them I wont return that damaged CD, BEFORE they send me a replacement along with a prepaid envelope to return the other cd. JPC.de refuse and claims this is their normal procedure. Pay close attention to the actual complaint I mentioned before: https://app.box.com/s/g8zie5pnjpa7dwg8rtea You will then understand fully why I find JPC.de procedure and handling of this complaint as totally unacceptable. I strongly advice others to find better and more realiable providers of such CD's! You will be able to find more similar bad experiences with this shop here: http://www.ciao.de/Erfahrungsberichte/jpc_de__21828
Prices are in the "acceptable" range - there are places cheaper than Lomax - but the customer service I got from them convinced me, that saving a few Kr somewhere else might not be the best idea after all.
Great service from Simonia - always helpful on the telephone. It is really nice to work with a merchant that sees the value of a brand and power of returning customers.
We had so far one case with a debtor that did not pay - it was above 50.000Kr ekskl. moms. HV was quick to setup us a paying customer. In the beginning it was looking all ok - all letters were sent and I could follow the case. Later on the mess began - no information was reaching me (regarding details of the "afrdragsordning" for example). We have been working very hard with the debtor to make sure they pay - so the grounds were set for HV people. Later on it turned even worse - it took them 3 weeks to figure out if anyone paid anything. Somehow they dig the "afdragsordning" from the grave and I got a copy. Now I have to spend another week to ask them, whether anything has been paid (I was promised by the debtor they will follow the payment scheme). Their self-service system contains errors - the case is "in bero" - I have no idea why. They claim to have registered extra payments - but there's no follow-up in the history, nor money on our bank account. I am a very understandable customer - never shouting, always trying to be nice. In business things can always go bananas - once or twice - but more than four strikes in a row is a waste of our time and money. So far we have paid 2495 + 2850 Kr ekskl. moms for HV assistance. The main reason to go with them was that they take our minds OFF thinking about the debt etc. (you know - so that we could focus on MAKING money). It ended up as a very frustrating experience - and I still do not know wheter the debtor paid something last week. From my observation it turns out that: they don't have control over payments, they don't have control over cases, despite promises they do not call back. I hope we are the only - soon to be former - customers of HV experiencing such treatment.
Entrepreneur? Have your own company? Telenor is not a telco for you. Every time I receive an invoice from Telenor I have to call their customer service because (pick one): the PDF cannot be downloaded or the PDF is not listed there or the remind password function does not work. Apart from that - every single change to your subscription has to be ordered via telephone and you are unable to check your consumption online - meaning - ZERO cost control and time-consuming management. The only good thing - telephone consultants - they were seriously trying to help. In 3 weeks time I'll be "Telenor-free" with a note "never again".
Fantastic solution for companies. Thanks to extensive self-service systems I have full control over every single aspect of my subscriptions through the Internet, 24/7. Huge offer, competitive prices and full control. The only thing that could be fixed is cheap international calls (as additional package) - but they have a forum, where customers can write/vote suggestions (which other telco does that?).
No problems with the order. I think they are the only shop in DK that has Lavazza Tierra/Pienaroma & Segafredo Espresso Casa on stock ;) For those that love Italian/French style dark roast - go for the allround mix they have - worth a shot!
I was checking many banks before making "the big switch", but eventually I went with AL-bank and now I can say - that was a good decision. On top of that in the beginning it was very important for me to have some "help & guidance" in English - and they provided it.
Ordered goods arrived quickly - no more comments to the order itself. As for other important things - everyone at the support office speaks English - and they even know what are they selling ;)
Ordered 2 sets of sunglasses, and received them 2 days after - exactly as promised!! Very competitive prices and on time deliveries.
Well, I have been a member on eBay since january 2001. Since that time the site has developed quite much. In generel eBay is a very great site which provides far the most tools for buying and selling. However as a seller I have very limited possibilities as I can only list items under a certain value. First, in 2012/13, it was up to $2500 per month, then it raised to $5000, and now it has just gone up to $7500. This is a very big problem for me, as I cannot use eBay as a serious tool to get scarce and rare items sold. They say "call us" and even though I live in Denmark I have tried to do so, but It's not possible. Even if you manage to find their phone number they have a intro phone system which does it impossible to get any contact. I have send them a registered letter I know for a fact they have read, but no answer and no solution. Result? I loose thousand and thousand of USD and eBay does a bad job and, too, loose a bunch of money in fees. NOT OKAY!! Everything could be perfect as a am a very serious and trusted eBay user, but it is not.
Jeg har altid haft godt med at handle hos TIKA. et plus er at de ringer dig op hvis der et problem med din ordre. jeg er glad :)
They called me up on phone, because an item was not in stock and suggested 3 alternatives by mail, which was great as I got an even better deal!
No problems at all, my glasses arrived exactly as predicted.
Made an order in January and not until this day I have received it. Sent several e-mails and never got a message. The order shows delivered on their website, but never go her. No tracking number, no response, no nothing....
I ordered the thing and two days after I received it. A big plus for the free transportation. I`ll definetly buy more from Smartsport!
I ordered a flipper case and the next day I received it. Great and fast service.
The reductions announced on the web site are fake. Say, an item is announced at "ab € 5.90" (from Euro 5.90) with the original price of 16.90 striked through. That would indicate prices from up 5.90 up to 16.80 at the very most. When I look through the colour and size combinations, all those I look at are still at 16.90. I buy anyway. The quality is good.
I ordered 2 packs @ 6 brush heads for my electric tooth brush. Received 2 packs @ only 3 heads. On Tuesday at 5.15 pm I emailed and asked. I'd consider that outside hours, but three quarters of an hour later they replied and promised to send the remaining heads. Thursday they were in the mail.
Kort for talt, så havde jeg ved booking af vores biletter tilvalgt og betalt for at få 2 kufferter med til Berlin fra CPH. Da vi skal hjem bliver vi opkrævet 2x70 eur for taskerne da vi "jo kun havde valgt at vi ville have kufferter med på udturen". Vi fik derfor valget mellem at betale 2x70 eur taskerne eller lade dem blive i tyskland. Jeg vil fremhæve at dette er over 460% af normal prisen pr kuffert. Se detajler nedenfor. Vi sendte et brev til Airberlin (se nedenfor) d. 18 Juli,  og har til dags dato d. 16 Oktober endnu ikke fået behandlet vores klage. Det er ikke godt nok! Aldrig mere Airberlin! Brev til kundenservice@airberlin.com sendt d. 18 Juli 2013: Hi Airberlin, My family and I recently traveled with you on a return flight from Copenhagen to Berlin (see attached invoice XXXXX). During on-line booking I could see that checked-in luggage was not included in the price of the fare; I therefore selected to book-in two pieces of luggage at a cost of 15 euro pr item (see invoice.). However, when we arrived at the airport in Berlin for our return flight to Copenhagen, we were told that the checked in luggage on our return flight was not included in our booking, even though I had chosen to pay for two pieces of luggage when booking the flight. At the service desk in Berlin airport I was informed that I had only booked luggage for the outward flight. When I booked the flight it was my clear impression that I paid for two pieces of luggage for both outward and return flights. I was then informed that I would need to pay 140 euro (2x70 euro) for return transport of our luggage (see attached "reciept1.jpg" and "reciept2.jpg"), which I found very irritating as I thought that I had ensured that the booking included baggage. I was further informed that I must have made an error when booking, as I would have had to pay an additional 2x15 euro for the bags for the return flight during booking. I can understand the need to book in luggage as a separate payment in order to keep flight fairs low, and paying 2x15 euro for the bags for the return trip is in my opinion acceptable. However, being demanded to pay 2x70 euro is in my opinion rather extortionate. At the service desk I was told that if I wanted to get on the flight with the bags I would need to pay the outstanding amount immediately and that I should then contact Airberlin by mail for a possible refund of the extra cost. In my opinion, I booked a return flight for 3 people, and at the time of booking chose to pay for two pieces of luggage. Having then to pay a fee of an additional 110 euro, due to an extremely unclear booking process, seems rather excessive. I booked the flight in good time, January 2013, and was convinced that everything was as expected and that the luggage was paid for and that I could look forward to my family holiday. I was apparently sadly mistaken. This situation revolves around what I consider to be an unclear booking process - you could also call it an honest mistake. I hope you can understand my frustration over this issue and that you will show a reasonable approach in trying to resolve the situation by refunding the difference in luggage fees amounting to 110 euro. I can also inform that you that the luggage on the outward flight was delayed by four days (see attached file "DelayedLuggage.jpg"), which I also consider as being poor service. Yours faithfully, xxxxxx
Excellent! I placed my order on Friday and have  the scarves on Monday next week. Quality is superb.
I ordered 3 boxes of dvd and they were delivered fast and all was in order. And the price was the lowest on the marked in DK at the time. Thanks :)
Nice products and side, but apple products are to costy
Plan to keep buying there. Just takes a bit of planing so I do only a few big purchases instead of many small.
When ordering business cards for my new company, we were 2 men designing and reading and controlling the text and layout, but when the order is paid, i can see on my account, that the backside of the card is changed by vistaprint, so instead of telling about the services i can offer my clients, as a landscaper, i now have a print used by dentist´s for apointments????? Now ill´have to tell 1000 customers abuot vistaprint and their stupid ways. I of course contacted "customer service", that garanties answer within 48 hours.... After 120 hours i have heard nothing. Really looking forward to bying other cards from ANOTHER company. Ill gladly pay extra...
i har mange gode ting til alle telefoner har anbefaldet et til en del
The customer care personel I spoke to was very unpleasent and cared very little to help me solve my problem. I feel very mistreated. I will never choose SAS again.
I was quite happy that I found mytrendyphone.dk with their wide selection of products. I bought a case for the Samsung tab 10.1 which was great. Unfortunately, the second item was a protector for the screen which reached me full of scratches and indented. There was no way to tell whether the scratches were on the protector itself or the plastic layer covering it. I contacted them, and they said that it cannot be refunded as it was used (Which I understand, fair enough). The reason I am giving only 3 stars is not because they did not refund it; but because they sent me a defective product in the first place.
I bought a leather jacket from Tøjeksperten just few minutes before they closed. When I tried it again at home, I found out that the leather smelled so bad. The next day I decided to return it back. One of the silica gel bags (the small bags you find in new clothes) was already torn inside the jacket pocket when I bought it (Which was fine with me). However, when I was returning it back, the guy from Tøjeksperten started to treat me like a criminal and asking with a nasty attitude if I had been enjoying the jacket at the beach as he was emptying the pocket from the silica gel crystals (He thought it was sand). It was vulgar and rude. And above all, he refused to return the jacket. Very unprofessional!
I have been a customer for over 3 years now, I have not had any bad experience. The staff is so friendly and the products they sell are of top quality. I love Naturkost Odense.
The best treatment I ever had! They are all so friendly and professional that I stopped going anywhere else (especially after being treated by other chiropractors). The chiropractor at Behandlertorvet is so knowledgeable. I cannot recommend her enough!
One of the best webshops i have ever seen. Easy to use and fast delivery! This will not be the last time i use it.
we are fully satisfied with your service and the sunglasses are perfect. Disappointed not to be able to make use of wine offer. Best regards Grith Lagermand
Quick delivery, the glasses carefully packed and on a quality as expected.
I bought a pair of shoes as a gift for my girlfriend from smartgirl, and it all worked perfectly like it also do everytime I shop from smartguy, which is a lot. No other webshop can compare. I always find the product I seek and even at a lower price than anywhere else.

I have ordered from Bike24 several times, and every time I have gotten my order promptly and without any problems.

I have ordered from aquatuning.de a few times now without too much hassle. Then this last time, I placed a retively simple order early monday at around noon - the items were first shipped wednesday, which is just not good enough. All major companies here in DK do their best to ship the items the same day they were ordered, so I expect exactly that from aquatuning!

This is the first time I purchasedfrom this company. I am fully satisfied.very nice and detailed telephonic service and a ver y fast deleivery.
har for nylig fået sat alarm op men det giver da en vis tryghed.
alt vel ! ve d de 2 handler jeg har haft med dem i jan 2011
No problems with cellular reception, they have made a transparent system of prices, which could be improved, but still is much better than other companies! I've become a telmore-freak, suggesting this firm to friends and family, as I can't see anything bad about it.
I don't understand how DR is allowed to circumvent laws, which prevents bulk sales (owning a TV, internet connection or radio requires one to pay license). I would like to compare this to having a fridge, and be required to pay a yearly fee to recieve cheese to put in the fridge. I do not want to pay for that other people are having cheese, when other less costly methods are available. DR could use video on demand or adding commercials to the TV. Forcing license upon us in these modern times, with many alternatives available online as well as on the TV (for free), is not fair for the population.
For our wedding last year, we decided to open an on-line wedding list with Illums Bolighus. Unfortunately this choice resulted in one of the most unprofessional and unpleasant customer service experiences we have ever encountered. Listed below are just a few examples of what we were faced with: 1. There were several problems with the on-line shop which made ordering for our international guests, in particular, problematic. 2. One of the wedding gifts ordered was sent directly to our home address 6 months before the actual wedding (although we had specified that we would pick up all the wedding gifts at the store after the wedding. 3. When we went to pick up the wedding gifts, a number of the gifts were missing / had not been packed. Furthermore, the packing list did not list which wedding gifts were from which guests making it very difficult to thank people for what they had bought us. 4. We ended up having to contact all our guests and ask them to specify who had given us what, so that we could prove this to Illums Bolighus in order to get the presents that were missing! 5. Our wedding list was closed without our consent, so the guests who wanted to buy us something after the wedding, were not able to do so. 6. When we complained to Illums Bolighus about the (lack of) service we had received, the HR Director's response was as follows: 'As it is clear that you are not satisfied with our customer service, i think that it is time to stop this correspondence now. I only had one wish, and that was to help you. Since your visit at Illums Bolighus, you have clearly made your point about us. We have now both used a lot of time and energy and I see no other way than ending this customer relationship now.'
I ordered batteries a month ago. I got the impression that the batteries were in stock in Denmark and expected them the next day. It took a month before I got them. The home page is totally unreliable.
lev som aftalt ingen problemer med dem her just do it
I haven't had any problems the 8 times or so i have ordered from Pro direct soccer, the shipping has taken the advised time or less and the goods have been as described. But i have a suspicion that some of the bad reviews here have been meant for 'Soccer Pro Direct UK' since it is Prodirectsoccer's Trustpilot page that pops up first when you google "soccerprodirectuk tustpilot" and not http://www.trustpilot.co.uk/review/soccerprodirectuk.co.uk and their goods seems quite fake
de har en god service men har et par fejl med regninger
Det var bare som jeg forventede . . . . . .  ; )
Er super glad for mit nye ur som lever op beskrivelsen , hurtig levering , alt i alt en god handel.
I chose to buy my ghd straightener and some Redken products from this page. It was easy and I had the products at home 3 days after and straightener after approx. 1 week. Easy peasy ;) I have ordered from this site a few times now and despite the fact that it differs from time to time it takes approx. 3-8 days for delivery (DK.), I am satisfied. The prices are great and so is the selection. I only miss NARS ;) I will definitely choose to do my shopping on this site again!
3 times i have placed an order. and all 3 times its perfect :D
My experience with Sunglassesshop.com was great. I needed some ear sockets for my Oakley sunglasses, but I couldn't find them at the website at first. I wrote a mail to their customer care, and they sent me a link to the site, where I could order the parts. I placed my order and about one week later, I received my package. I can't say anything bad about this experience, and I would surely recommend Sunglassesshop to anyone looking for new sunglasses.
2 par shorts / knickers, 2 skjorter også et par gratis strømper oven i
I found my valve at Lavpris VVS. It was cheap and the goods arrived within one working day
I ordered a pair of sunglasses from the German Smartbuyglasses.de site. On delivery two weeks later, I unexpectedly had to pay an additional €29 for custom duty as the parcel was sent from Hong Kong into the EU.
Vi har forsikret alt hos top dk. Og de var de beste til prisen.
I am really glad with onfone and all related services , you can find what you want and what you need in diffrent offer of ONFONE.
We got a good price, but also a very nice car, comfortable and with very low fuel consumption, so we did not need to refill the tank. Handling was smooth.
Det er en super fin hjemmesidde .... god service ... hurtig levering.
Fin service hurtig levering  alt i alt en god oplevelse at handle her
I got my microsim in 2 days, got mails on how to use the service and how to customize it according to my needs. For the price i paid , specially comparing to other compatitors in the market (TDC and Telia when my family has expericens with) , the service was on top!
alt var helt i top - hurtig levering - super vare
Whenever I have been in contact with Techniker Krankenkasse, I have receive The most helpful service. It is always informative, friendly and honest. Not only do they answer all your questions but, if there's something you might have overlooked, they are knowledgeable and will provide you with all the information needed. I would recommend TK to anyone.
I got my sunglasses, even a day before i was meant to get them! And i live in Denmark (shipped from the UK) "Only" 4 starts because i didnt get my track and trace number in the email. I got it later after i contacted them. In order to get 5 stars from me, everything has to be perfect. A small mistake, nothing serious. If i need sunglasses in the future, this is now my site to purchase from!
We bought 2 MacBook + 1 Apple Display + 2 Apple Care protection plan. After having paid, the employee told us that he did the Apple Care activation and that we should receive the Apple Care confirmation by post. "everything is taken care of, nothing else to do". It seemed a bit strange to us (since you need an apple id to do so) but we went on. It appeared that the Apple Care was not activated (and you only have 30 days to do so). Moreover, when trying to register the Display to the Apple Care plan. The serial number could not be registered. So we had to send a "proof" of buy to Apple to be able to activate the protection plan on the screen. As Humac is a registered and approved Apple retailer, I would have expect to have that done automatically. Next time, we'll buy everything online since there is no price difference and the apple delivery is SO fast. #FAIL
They handle your order really fast, and even when they have to send something international, it's often faster than the national service in Denmark
Det er en fornøjelse at handle hos dem alt fungerer. ..
Fra bestilling til levering 2 dage med en weekend imellem - super
Homeexchange.com offers a wonderful opportunity for individuals to exchange their homes. However, that said, the site owners are becoming lately more money grubbing. For providing a site for members to exchange their homes, they have increased the annual fee and in the latest email offer: extra for making an "automated search" which logically should be included. If Homeexchange continue their primary focus on charging too much money from its members, other sites will emerge and take over, focusing more on the fact that it is their members, who creates the wonderfulness - not the site.
Easy to order and fast delivery. I will recommande the site to all my friends.
jeg er rigtig glad for den service jeg har fået :)
Ordered a navigation device, a great offer, hoping it would come within the week - and it was here in two days... Brilliant
I've used Amazon for a few years now, and there customer service is just superb. It is without doubt my favorite online shopping place, both because of good prices, but mainly cause if something is wrong with the product they just replace it, no bull, no nothing, and they even ship the replacement before they receive the old one back, so there is as little trouble as possible for the customer. Oh yeah, and free shipping to DK by supersaver if i buy for more than 25 pounds, is just great to.
I had trouble with my payment, but SmartGirl's Customer Service helped walk me through the various steps until my order was confirmed.
I am always happy with Smartguy, this time I wanted a pair of red shorts for training, not too long in the leg, and there they were, a perfect pair from Jack Jones.
No problems at all, my item was delivered next day.
Not being a millionaire and never  tasted the authentic Blue Mountain, I decided to try the next-best  thing, and I must say this version is no disappointment, and I guess very close to the expensive brew. A beautiful smooth coffee, a relief from the  harsh stuff that is found in Danish supermarkets. I will definitely order again.
I ordered a case for my HTC Touch2, but received the wrong one. I have tried to contact Nemoware several times by email, but no reply. I tried to contact Nemoware through another of my email addresses, and still nothing. As I live only about twenty miles away from the address, I drove to the premises, it was a private house. Nobody home and looked as though it was not occupied. I left a note in the mail box asking for a telephone call, but no joy. So I don't recommend this business, and I am going to contact the Town Halll of Odense in Denmark. BE AWARE!
Once again very good service, delivery within a couple of days. This time I purchased a Henri Lloyd sweater, and I have no complaints, a quality name at an affordable price.
A great assortment of quality underwear. Freight charges are reasonable and convenient delivery. Would like to see some designer Polo-Shirts at a "nice" price.
Highly recommendable. Sunglasses were shipped same day as order. The prices are super low, and the webpage works magnificently with all the selection criteria.
A really nice jacket. I love it and it's all perfect.
Det er første gang jeg handler med EL grossisten, men det var ok god varer ok levering.
Next day delivery service to the work place means no trip to the post office - Excellent and many thanks
I cannot recommend FOTO.com to anyone. We ordered photos for Christmas presents and we have been charged 2 weeks ago but we have not received the photos. You cannot call them and help.dk@foto.com does not answer your email. Please dont buy any products at FOTO.com ever!!!!
I ordered 7-8 different things from the firm, received very quickly an orderconfirmation, and the next day I got a mail telleing me that one of the things had beeb´n changed, but to a better one, and the parcel was delivere´d as promised. I paid the money the day after I got my parcel. So I'm happy
It was a fast and easy buying process. Not that long waiting time. But one of the zippers is already broken and ive had it for about 1 week...
I ordered to pairs of sunglasses and I received them in perfect condition just a couple of days after placing my order - and this is my third time shopping at Sunglassesshop! Highly recommended.
Danish company with excellent customer service and very fast delivery. Highly recommendable.
I bought ink for my 2 years (very old!?) Lexmark Printer (nearly impossibly to find Ink in Denmark) twice within 2 weeks. First packet arrived after 3 days and the second packet after 4 days. It's better than I had expected because of previous bad experiences with Pixmania delivery times
God service hurtig levering alt i alt en god oplevelse.
Very good and fast service, received my order just in couple of days time!
jeg syndes jeg har haft en go oplevelse de gang jeg har haft  kontakt med cchobby.
Fantastisk dag til dag levering - value for money -

Alting var bare i orden. Det var en fornøjelse at handle med dette firma
I just wrote Sixt an Email, concerning this matter. But i wanted to share it here aswell. I called the German Call center to rent a Mercedes C class. The price the operator could quote me, was a bit higher than the price shown online. However the price i was reffering to was a special "weekend" only offer, and therefore i couldnt get it at that price. We have a minor chit chat about it, and i descide not to rent the car. And as i am about to hang up, he tells me. " I can do a special offer for you" - which i consider a good way to keep costumers, who where about to leave your store :) However, the initial price was around 290 euro for 3 days. But he quoted me 220 Euro for 3 days. And i accepted - asking offcourse, if all the terms where the same. Drove from Copenhagen to Harislee - and when i pick up the car, i get told that the price he quoted me was with NO insurance at all. Which means, that i was basically self responsible for any damage costs to the car. I then ask, "well whats the price including the insurance?", and i get quoted the 290 euro again. So here i am, at 16:45 in Harislee, with the possibility of going 900 km'ers in my own car, or my rented car. Cause the clerk at the desk isnt going to change the price or try and fix it. I end up paying, the full amount, and leaving with the car. They upgraded me to a more expensive car, which btw wasnt cleaned inside really well. So i guess, that if you pay close to 300 euro to borrow a car 3 days - be carefull you get what you order. I aint using Sixt again. *********************** UPDATE *************************** I was contacted by Sixt after my complaint written here on trustpilot. They excused the mistake, and refunded me the difference from the price i ordered at and the price i paid. My main concern wasnt really the money, it was the fact that i fealt wrongfully treated by their company. But a full appolegy and a refund is as much as you can ask for in a situation like this. Thumbs up for putting things right! :) best regads. Michael
They were very fast at delivering the items ordered and all was as specified on the homepage. As a consequence I have no bad things to say about them and as a consequence they get a full house - five stars.
The only suggestion I could make is to have a page with very clear pictures of all the different kinds of cable connectors(ends) with their names so we non technical people can more easily identify the cable we need.
Dear Serviceteam at SmartBuyGlasses, Thank you very much we have received the sunglasses so everything is well here :O)) Even though we had to wait till after our summer holiday to get the glasses they were worth waiting for – my husband is very pleased with them ☺ So again thank you for your very service minded support and information along the way – I will definitely shop here again … :O) (and gladly tell others to use you as well) Have a nice day Regards Merete
I feel very safe ordering food at this site! If something goes wrong, the have a customer care department, whom can help you!
in my case the package was delivered to another person who simply wrote my name instead of signature... i see the problem here is that the delivery guy (driver) has no example to compare the real signature to the given one. so i would offer to the company to require a signeture from the costumers when they are chosing the service of the company and if they do not attach a copy of it, they should be warned about the small risk of mistaking... well anyway i got my package next day after i complained, so the service worked out the solution.. and i thank them for that :) M.V.H.

Having mailed about the breakdown - using my wireless backup  connection - I got an explanation. That is OK - failures occurs and the breakdown was short - but I needed  to ask to get an explanation.
I ordered a steam mop on the internet which had serious malfunctions. I have wrote them an e-mail and ask to replace the product or refund the money. 7 weeks after I have send back the mop with all accessories in the original packaging I got back only the engine without mouth, rags and all the other accessories. How am I supposed to use it? I will make an official complain against them to the Forbrugerklagenævnet.
I wanted to buy a pair of shoes for my husband for his birthday, and liked the Urbis from Soul collection. There was no size chart on the product, even though a message saying to look at the "the chart below" was displaying. So, I contacted them via email. The first reply I received they obviously did not care to read my question close enough. I emailed again and asked what size I should choose "the European or the Brazilian" and even said I had bought shoes in Brazil before, and knew the sizes were different. The second reply I received they mentioned the flip flop chart and even put a print screen on the chart. Here is what they said on the last reply prior to purchasing: "We confirm you hereby that the size charts for the Soul Collection sent the 19.04. is correct.  Furthermore, the same chart will be visible again on our online store during the next week." Well, I made the purchase and they shipped me a 39 instead of 41 - they sent a European size, and I ordered a Brazilian size, FOLLOWING THE CHART THEY THEMSELVES EMAILED TO ME. To my surprise they called it "a point of view" and even after I sent them back all the emailed I received from them, they refuse to admit they made a mistake, and refuse to reimburse my shipping costs. Below is their last reply: "Dear Paula, Thanks for your mail and this information. It seems there has been a mixed up between the "flip flop" collection and the "Soul" collection. Indeed, Flip flops are mentioned in Brasilian size, Soul products are mentioned in European sizes. If you take the "flip flop" chart in account to order an article of the Soul collection, the shoes will never meet your requirment. In this regard, we have to remain on our point of view concerning the refund you are asking for. We remain at your service." HAS HAVAIANAS EVER HEARD OF CUSTOMER RIGHTS? IS THIS HOW YOU VALUE YOUR CUSTOMERS? I wrote this at your Facebook group, as you can see the image on this review - let's see if it will simply be deleted.
Hi, Can you imagine in 4 month's received 5 routers and all of them DEFECTS some time after one week. I'm sure that you repack the old one from another customer and send it again to other. Right now i have no Telephone & internet since last week, everyday i should call the support and tell them the story again, and they have 3 answers : 1. reset your router. 2. wait 10 min and start again. 3. Technician guy should check your issues from TDC, we call you back in 5 min. everyday the same sh*** until 17:00 then they said: srry, call us during our time or send email to bla bla ...etc. i was with fullrate for almost 3 years, never an small problem, but since Nov 2011 just wasting time and cheating! That's why no more with you again, until today paid 476dkk to mobile internet, because you routers not working as always... Regards
den er bare en god netbutik som giver god service og en god behanling af ens ordre.
I would certainly recommend CFK Furniture. I ordered a bed as there were 6 weeks for delivery. After 3 weeks I find out that the bed is too big for the room as it should be in. I wrote that I would like to cancel the order and get a call 2 days later. We agree that I would send my bank information and they will return my money. I send a reminder once for money but I had them on my account about 10 days after I talked to them. I would say that it is really nice service
Have you ever been afraid to buy your furniture online, been afraid that the quality was to bad or that you cant get a hold on customerservice or even that you will never receive the things you have ordered? At Voga.com you dont have to be! The price is more than fair and the quality of the furniture is excellent. But what makes Voga better than all the other combined, is their customerservice. We have ordered furniture at Voga.com twice, and both times we have been in close contact with their costumerservice, both by email and phone. We have experienced a small delay in our last order, and for that we have been highly compensated and their costumerservice has done all in their power to make the delay as small as possible and has keept us informed at all times. All in all, we can only recommend Voga.com and even though it might seem like a long time to wait up to 13 weeks for you new furniture to arrive, it is worth the wait in every way.
Having searched online for a fare to Colombo I tried to buy the tickets with QA. Using their online booking systeme everything went fine until purchase. Then error.... Tried again. This time with a message that the booking I made wasn't apllicable for the fare I was quoted..... Point is that the system allowed me to chose dates, times fares, meals and everything up until actual payment step 2. Then I tried to contact QA. Their response was a nice Email with absolutely no recognition of the actual issue. Instead they quoted me a new fare twice the amount stated in their offering .... on the homepage .... In Denmark false marketing is not legal ... Are they for real ??
I have been using TeleNordic for the past seven or eight years. Since they introduced City card they are the only service I use for calling friends and relatives in the US. More than 20 hours of calls for kr 100. Do the math. No need to worry if someone is at home or on their computer. Once the set up has been made everything is one touch of the dial away. Their support is great. While live hours are limited if you run in to problems on a week day after office hours just shoot them a mail and they'll answer.
Nice and smooth transaction, wonderful flower arrangement. I am one happy customer.
Ok deal, but was not aware that autoescape is a search engine and not a rental company.
Kan kun give den bedste anbefaling til at handle i www.lavprishvidevarer. Alt i alt en god oplevelse
Tire order was cancled without informing me or consdidering  a replacement order on 16th dec 2010 ---- dear Ladies and Gentleman, I ordered on Nov 25th Tires for a Peugeot 107 (Dunlop Sp Winterresponse on steel rims). supposed delivery date 02. dec 2010 - after 7 Days I was told that the tires are with the transport company and they need to investigate where they are, and we will be contacted - and we have not been contacted - I needed to call again. then the Call center employee told me she has to investigate she couldnt find a reason, then after two days I called again , eventhough Dækonline wanted to call back , and same staory - no clue what was ongoing,  then on 21 Dec 2010 was I told after I called again - that the order is cancled because you could not get steel rims,  I was basicly waiting for tires in these weather conditions and no one told me anything. from my point of view should there have been a different rim or a cheap Alu rim delivered but not cancle the order without any information.... espscially after for more than three weeks I was told nothing. The money was taken from the account immediatly with the order and I hope the return of the money will happen within the next 2 - 3 days. I used to order tires- as did my friends or I did for them in Germany as well before because I also recomended you becuase it was good - but sorry to say this time it went wrong and I turely need to reconsider using you again... service and follow up and information was not existing. I was now forced to order tires at an other place - what as well was more pricely and a less good quality tires, since I needed the tires urgently and I didnt have time to make a CVR registration to receive a MwSt free delivery to Denmark. sincerely Jan Jensen/Unistaal Oliver Gottlieb/NP
Har været glad for at handle hos jer , fin levering .
I seek wiley x sunglass and this firm was cheapest
The batteries were delivered very fast and they work perfectly fine. I can recommend the seller.
Kazi networks has been hosting my websites for years with out any issues at all, always helpful and knowing customer service.
Top quality delivered in a beautifull box makes it feel like christmas when you receive your clothing from Bruuns.
They have fresh new fruit and very varied selection of food.
We now know what is healthy and what is not ,so please help us customers in able to chose more burgers with buns with a little fiber please. Or cheese that has much more taste and looks like cheese ! And all burgers have too little salad,onions and tomatoes.... The best burger so far is the chicken salsa burger - really good taste !!
I would have given -zero- but seems scale only goes from one to five hence maximum one. When I order flowers in advance for delivery on a specific date I do expect them to be delivered ON THAT DATE irregardless. In my case because the receiver was not in the office when the flowershop called they decided to deliver the following date, which was one day too late. -- Your reply indicate to me that it doesn't really matter what I, who pays for the flowers, ask for. You make your own decission on when you want to deliver irregardless your customers wish.....hmmmm
Happy to say, that its great place to shop. Good service when items gets delayed. They answer right away when you write to customer support.
man for en super god service hos wahoo og hvis der er et problem så ringer man bare
Website indicated item in stock, after ordering mail said out of stock with option to cancel. Item arrived after about a week with tracking. Slow but otherwise ok.
Perfect buy - I will do it again and tell eveyone about how easy it is to buy sunglasses here.
Orville Media is one of the select few who believe in good quality, customer service, and honest business through and through. It's been a pleasure working with them and I will continue to do so in the future. My best regards to all the employees at Orville Media. /Kim
Very fast delivery, well packaged ... and best price that I could find. This is my second purchase with them.
dette er bare en super mailbox.. Kan varmt anbefales til iPhone !
I think ther service is excelent, but the prices are a little to high.
Too slow. for about 10 days since I have refunded one item and until now not receiving confirmation. With ordinary post they should receive item within 4 days. I do not think I would buy more from asos
Got what expected. Fast, no probs with delivery for good value. Looks like guys know what they are doing ! Maybe not everything is there and not that wide assortment(pretty wide already). Expecting it get wider in near future. Highly recommended!
First of all information about the product was incorect on web page. Shipment took much more longer than 2-3 days. Secondly, you were postponing 2 or 3 times the day of recieving. Waiting line in customer service is way too long, but you have to pay for waiting time. Next time I'll use getmore, I'll consider that the information on web page might not be truthworthy and before making an order will call to customer support and ask about the product that I want to buy. But it is very inconvinient, because you have to wait almost 30 minutes, you will spend money and you will spend extra 30 minutes of your time while doing purchase. Taking all this into consideration I would prefer to spend less time and money in another web shop buying same product, but maybe a bit more expensive. Practical Shippent by itself is good. Everything is packed good, no scratches, product is clear, whole and without diffects. Quality for Shippment is 5 stars. Web page, except some misinformation, looks good, and works great, everything is clear and understandable I'd give 4.5 for web page
Works as expected, had my coins the day after i made the banktransfer :)
Loved that got 4 mails for every stage of processing -- ordered, payment received, sent etc.  Got my goods quickly, will use again.
God information - hurtig levering - alt i alt en rigtig god oplevelse
Jeg har haft en super oplevelse med at handle online hos Magasin
On a mistake by us they were most helpful in tracking down some wine that had gone astray ( wasn't even their wine!) and they returned it to us without charge!
Very useful information provided and comparatively affordable prices. Very reliable organisation. 4 stars for you
I placed an order (400 euros) 1 month ago but they never shipped it. I tried several times  to contact Fietspunt but they never respond. Now I have lost my money and I send out this warning - do not trust this company!
Det er sjovt og let at gå til . Og en superhurtig levering !
I bought a mercedes E220Cdi back in 2009. The official sale description said 138.000 but when car was recieved the car has been running 145.000 km. The car crashed every month and i had to spend 40.000 kr for the car at the time i had at. After 1 year the engine broke down. I contacted hedin bil several times with arrogance answers
I love kimchidvd and I have ordered several items from them. Everything is top notch and defiantly recommendable!
Tried a 3 courses gourmet dinner in June 2011 at a reasonable price. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that it was the best service and food that I've ever had.
I must say, that I was quite nervous when I made my first order. Filling out just my e-mail and Bitcoin adress and then making a bank transfer to Bitcoin Nordic made me a little nervous. BUT...after just a few hours i got my Bitcoins (danish bank transfer) For the danes and EU-citizens Bitcoin Nordic is just the best!
I have used asos a lot of times and it's always cheap. But i have received the wrong sizes a couple of times and it is really annoying! When i have to return i have to pay and then they will transfer money back to me. It's a bit difficult and it makes the service really bad.
We ordered two luxury quality, electric, kitchen items by a famous manufacturer. Wupti charged us for using Dankort! When I rang up to discuss the charge the operator hung up on me! Wupti then sent both items rattling about in a box the size of a telephone kiosk! One of the items was obviously returned as damaged goods. The box had clearly been opened, the loose packaging inside was damaged, there was scratched enamel, even previous customer's fingerprints all over the back and a dreadful paint finish! The enamel clearly had fluff *under* the paint. Obviously seconds or a grey import. By sheer luck the other item was fine. It was agreed we would return the damaged item. The new one  was no better! Again there was hair and fluff easily visible under the paint. On an 800DKK toaster! I rang Wupti  again and it was agreed they would refund the cost of this item. Wupti only get one star because I had no other choice. I'd give them a minus score if I could. A dreadful experience from start to finish. Never (ever) again. Wupti gives other online dealers a bad name which they don't deserve! Avoid Wupti like the plague!

It was a great pleasure to reserve a summer house through them. I choose them because the website is very advanced and makes it easy to search for homes. It was also very easy to solve an issue with them: when I made a booking and paid the first half of the price we decided to go for another summer house, so I called them to cancel my booking. After a quick chat with their support (Kim Andersen) the problem was solved, my old booking was cancelled and a new house resolved. I successfully got the full refund for the cancelled reservation.
I've been trying to establish an account in this bank and I got the most indifferent service ever. Everything started with "Ring mig op om LSBprivat® Løn med 5 % i rente" link, where I left my details so the bank can contact me. The first reply I got was a week after I left the contact request. After that I come to the office (Norreport st) and had a nice chat with Lars who insured me that I only have to send them some extra papers and they will establish the account. After I sent all the documents I have never been contacted again. Lars has never replied to my status request and it is impossible to get through their phone waiting queue. So it has been 2 month by now when I first contacted them. If the bank doesn't even bother to establish an account, then I can imagine how hard it would be to work with them if I finally managed to fight myself through their indifference.
Have bought Samsung Galaxy II there. No problem so far :-) Nice that you can pick up the order directly in the shop. The only thing I didn't like is that when registering on the website there is no SSL protection and password is also stored in open text on the server.
Unfortunately letters from non-English alphabet appears to be question marks on the greeting card in my order. I didn't get any warning on the website when I was ordering the flowers and the text of the greeting card was correct in the order summary but not on the actual card. Didn't expect this from an international service. The flowers themselves were nice, but the first impression has been spoiled.
Ordbogen. com is a good tool. Certainly, in the three or four years that I have used Ordbogen, it has got better and better. Still, from a professional point of view, it cannot always be relied upon to deliver the right translation, so I use it a tool to jiggle my memory and for that - it's perfect ;-)
Det er en super god service , tak for det coolshop.
Don't be bothered with them, very unprofessional. Ordered a camera bag that supposed to be delivered within 2 days. After 5 I wrote and asked them what is going one with no reply. I finally wrote them again after one day and asked my order to be canceled. This time they answered to confirm my cancellation (!).
it is a good company, good articles and a excelent webshop
have used groupon 5-6 times. every time have i had no problem getting my product or using groupon portal.
I have changed my mind after just 20 minutes after placing the order 33607244 in the middle of the might. And they only could cancel 1 item ( only because I have re-odered it), but not another one. So, in  spite of the  fact of cancelling, they sent it to me anyway after 15 hours next day. And now I have to pay tracking fee , which I neither have chosen,  for the order I have cancelled  because of the tracking fee, beyond the trouble with the returning of the item. How it is possible not to manage to cancel the order processed in the middle of the night after 20 min after ordering and 15 hours before despatching?????? There customer service is very rigid and no common sence is present.They have deleted all our correspondence at my account so I am not able to answer them that they have to change there ordering system and make improvement at there customer service!!!! They exist only because of the customers !!!! People believe that they have a good service- ya, .... just wait until something goes wrong! And now I have read the other reviews, and many had the same experience with cancelling even after 5 minutes. It is simply impossible to cancel! You have to pay no matter if you did the mistake or their system does not work. I know, that I never have chosen the button with the order tracking, that gives extra costs. I discovered later when i've got the confirmation with a bigger sum that expected. Tried to cancel, and have reordered one of the items, and only this item was possible to cancel from the first order. If your order there- no money return no matter what... And they will feed you with "sorry"s  without changing anything.
A user friendly website, made our booking/reservation much easier and we love the concept with family room with both bonks and a 2 bed for the adults. Great
I have bought products from Army Star 2 times. The first time i ordered trousers, socks and jacket. Promised delivery time was within 6 days. It took about 3 weeks for it to arrive and i didnt get the sock because they were out of stock. The jacket was to small although i had used the size guide and called customer service to inquire about sizes. I did get a 15% discount on the next purchase to make up for it. The second time i ordered another jacket. Size was fine according to the size guide and it arrived only 2 days after i placed the order.
the company will not sell to you if you live in denmark and use creditcard because there has been an increase in card freud from denmark(the company say) funny i live in denmark and i have not heard that its a problem in this country i have bought many times from au-nz-usa-uk before and have never been said no from a company to use my card this you first find out when you get an email after you have ordered i have searched severel hours after the things that i needed and finally when i found it the company is some not serius company
It is time consuming to get Amazon to send you a check for a sale made on Amazon. It takes 90 days after you have fisished an completely foolish payment procedure, and you have to remind Amazon - after 90 days - that Amazon shall send the check. So Danes, Sweedes an Norwegians: Never sell on amazon
just before I'm home?????? And then I have to go the post office to collect my package....
3 weeks ago, i ordered a snapback cap and a college jacket from kickz, they send me a confirmation E-Mail saying that they had confirmed my order, 2 weeks later i didnt hear anything from them, so i wrote a mail, and suddenly they said, that i should transfer the money directly to they account, so i did, and now my package has almost arrived, but i think that its irritating that they do not tell me, that i have to transfer the money to them, before they send the package, i am NOT happy for that.
I am very satisfied receiving my parcel very short time after placing my order. Your service is VERY good and the delivery quick. Thank you so much.
Alt for lang leveringstid i forhold til hvad de lover :-(
De har mange ting til fornuftige priser, men deres service er dårlig,
Det er bare en ok forretning..man for de ting man bestiller..det er en fornøjelse ;))
I placed an order for around 8 lamps with IKONM early July and so far i have still not received half the goods. The first shipment received of 2 lamps had dents on the lamps and marks of rust. After having a long email correspondence IKONM finally accepted to pick up the damaged goods and refund my Money. The Financial refund however took very long and it was only after several reminders from my side that the Money finally was refunded. I then received the second shipment two weeks ago of 2 additional lamps (end September) and once again then one of the lamps had dents on it and i want to have it returned. In addition then i have been informed that the 4 pending lamps I ordered early July this year can not be shipped to me until end December, wherefore i have asked to have these 4 lamps cancelled since we simply cant wait that long when the order was placed in July. So far i have sent 4 reminders to the customer service email and still have not received any reply about neither the return of the dented lamps i have once Again received in September or the 4 lamps I want to cancel since 5 months delivery is not acceptable! The service is simply non-existing and I find it appalling that I paid for goods in July, which I have still not received and the goods I indeed have received have had dents on 50% of them. I am super happy with one of the lamps I received, but not replying to your customers despite numerous reminders, not accepting to return goods when they are not in the condition required is simply not ok. Today I will send the 5th reminder to their service customer service and I sincerely hope we will get a reply soon! But i can say for sure that I will NEVER place orders with IKONM Again and I would strongly recommend the company to review their customer service functions!
I purchased bags from carriealong twice, and I'm impressed of the service. Will buy more for sure.
Bought shampoo and hair conditioner for the 2nd time. The service was fine, and fast BUT I live in the country side and I had to drive about 30 km to pick up my order at a post office that wasn't cool. Anyway, that wasn't shampooshoppen's fault. So, I give 5 stars for the shop and  no star  for postDanmark.
I have just found this site, and it's very new. But still it looks really good, and their customer service was really friendly and helpful.
My husband gave me a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses for christmas. I loved them, but they were size 55, so too small for my face. I had several korrespondances with one guy working at customerservice. He gave me all the right pieces of advice and guided me, so i got the right sunglasses :-)... He was very professional... Thank you. I highly recommend SmartBuyGlasses... :-)
Det var som sædvanligt en god oplevelse at handle hos DVDOO.
I have ordered from coolshop many times, and am extremely satisfied with the day-to-day delivery, no postage costs and extreme good prices, compared to other online stores! I can highly recommend coolshop to anybody looking for all those qualities :)
I have 2 domains at Unoeuro, and have recommended at least 6 people (they are also very satisfied). Communication is fast, stable, easy and reliable. Other companies delivering the same (more expensive) services can seriously not compete... I have tried many! I build websites for people, and always recommend they establish an account at Unoeuro - so my work is made 100% easier :) Your customer service also delivers fast and friendly support.
Key within minuts and working without any VPN work. Even at a pretty decent price.
Var glad for dem før, men nu er jeg ikke specielt glade for dem.
I have ordered a USB key from meinpaket. They promised me a delivery after 2 week days. After 16 week days nothing happened. I contacted the supporter many times, and they seems to be completely uneducated to understand my wish and demands. The costumer service is absolutely the worst shitty treatment ever. I had to cancel the order. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM MEINPAKET FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
In less than 2 hours I learned to use the platform and set up the general stuff and if you put an effort in working a few extra hours you can really make a kicking ass webshop. I have been so happy to use the Shooples platform to create my webshop. Now I'm just looking for the right product(s) to sell.. and the possibilities are endless. The team behing is super professional and very helpful if you have any kind of bugs in relation to anything in regards of setting up your webshop.
I find Golfshoppen to be a nice and reliable web-shop. It would benefit from a larger selection of items!
some problem with high speed but i'm in a downtown area for the rest the service is stable and reliable. Thanks.
I have ordered from Crazy Factory a few times now, and I absolutely love it. The prices are amazingly low and the service just as good.
jeg er meget glad for den vare jeg købte , super
I buy here every month. Delivery takes two weeks to Denmark, but it's worth it. I trust this awesome site! Love from Denmark.
Fin handel, hurtig levering og go service - alt i alt en go betjening.
My time with FDM has been an endless stream of mistakes by the staff, each of which has inevitably ended up in me having to pay more! Their prices are cheap, but for that you get friendly but incompetant staff who constantly give the wrong information and never make any attempt to genuinely help you. I honestly feel that I am not covered should the worst happen and I need to make a claim. The only thing I have tried to make a claim on since is getting my windscreen replaced, and they even managed to get out of paying for that - even though they told me specifically that I have friskadedaekning when I joined, that turned out not to be true. FDM as an organisation is there to help and educate motorists, but having been a member of FDM Forsikring for almost 2 years, I have realised that this is specifically the kind of company that FDM should be warning its members about.
helt sikkert et stad jeg er glad for at handle super job i gør guys
its good and can not bee better in this fucking world
I found the sportsproduct I was looking for and used the price pledge since I had seen it cheaper in another online store, it took them a week to answer but they matched the price. Their delivery costs are in the high range. From ordering to dispatch it took a week and almost another week for the delivery, the tracking of the shipment was poor, bad experience.
They had the product at the absolut best price in the market (sale). From ordering to delivery i took one week (UK to DK). Only issue was that from the charge of the order amount on my creditcard until I received the dispatch information, it took 2 days....and I therefore wondered if they only charged my account and never would send the product. One year later I had a warranty case. Instead of sending me a replacement (they didn't have the 2011 model in stock, but could have returned a 2012 model) the returned they amount paid initially. So if you make a good deal on sale at them, you can't be sure to get a replacement if it's cheaper for them to make a refund in a warrenty case and your are then forced to buy the product again at a higher price (at their site if you dare).
I have for many years bought all my music from cdwow, and I have always been satisfied. Great shop, cheap products and great service from cdwows stab.
Det er ikke sidste gang jeg handler hos jer !
We were looking for a specific set of ski goggles and Sunglassesshop came up in the Google search. The goggles were packed and send the next day and arrived in a few days.
I have 4 times order a coffee from www.kaffekompagniet.com  . And always order have been send same day. So day after I  got my coffee. This is a great service. Eggert
I always look for Desigual shops when i'm abroad, I look forward to being able to go there when i,m at home as well..... Why not open one in Copenhagen....
By far the easiest way to order take out, can the website be better, probably yes but this is so much better then waiting on the phone or having a busy signal. people complaining about delivery charges: well they are set by the restaurant not exactly Just-Eat's fault nor can they do anything about it. same goes for late delivery's Just-Eats system contacts the restaurant and they reply back with an expected delivery time, if they are unable to keep it the restaurants fault not Just-Eat. Their point shop however is crap and id really like for some decent rewards possible discount codes or something more usefull. but from time to time there is things worth having  (got a ps3 game a year or so back)
I would like to express my opinion regarding the 2 slimming treatments I have done at Star Shape. I found that the procedure of both Tei 1 treatment, which tightens one’s body muscles  and Tei 2 treatment, which burns one’s body fat, were very positive and fulfilled all my expectations. The girls at Star Shape are always very helpful and considerate doing all they can to make the treatments pleasant and successful to the customers. I would definitely recommend Star Shape to whoever is interested in the type of treatments they offer, the clinic is nice and clean and the entire staff is always very attentive and kind at all times.
I would like to express my gratitude to Atef El Kher from kirurgirejse for the well organized trip, to all that travelled to Belgium, including myself, for a bariatic bypass on 17 october. I found that the process both before and after the operation was well considered and fulfilled all my expectations. Atef El Kher was helpful and considered at all times, making sure the different situations both before and after the operation went as smoothly as possible for everyone. However, it is impossible for him to be in charge of how each and everyone will react after the operation. Thus, it is important to have an open mind and take oneself responsibility for ones condition, bearing in mind that for each hour that passes one feels better and that after just a couple of days one is completely back to normal. I would definitely recommend kirurgirejser to whoever fulfills the necessary requirements for a bariatic operation. Dr. Dillemans is highly qualified, attentive and considered, his staff of doctors is highly professional, the hospital was nice and clean and the entire staff very attentive and kind at all times.
A smooth & fast transaction. They were extremely helpful & prompt with delivery.
Thank you for a quality product, just what i wanted and a very quick delivery.
Startupbootcamp is driven by truly amazing people. this is a world class opportuinty that any smart entrepreneur will know to take.
The quality of the services and of the products convinced me to act again on ebuy24.dk!
O ordered 4 DVD (one of them hardly to find and I was surprised when I saw it on billigCD.dk website). I am not the type to say easy "Perfect", but in this case... it is "Perfect" by three times: for price, for "rare" stuff you can find, for fast delivery!
I bought a bed at Your store a while back, and the other day one of the legs broke. I came into the store with the broken leg and told them what happened (and asked if it was possible to buy a new one or if I had to buy a whole new set....bur they told me: "Go home and get the rest of the legs and come back and You will get a whole new set!....so I went home, came back, and they gave it to me for free, I didn´t even have the receipt with me! THAT IS WHAT I CALL 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Thank You again Guys! I will definitely shop more often at Your store now!....and my friends that I have told about it so far are amazed over the treatment and I think and hope You will get atleast some more customers from my recommendation! You are The Best!
I ordered a blouse by Bruuns. I received an order confirmation but I never received the blouse. I called customer servíce (very friendly customer service) who informed me that the blouse was sold out. Quite disapointing and annoying that you had to follow up yourself.

I have used Abebooks a couple of times, and I am truly amazed about what you can find - and the books were very cheap - even cheaper than what I could find them for through ebay!! For the future abebooks will be my first choise, when it comes to books - that's for sure! :) Great site ++++++++++ Thanks from Denmark :)
I am very satisfied, and would gladly recommend the site to other teachers, or privae people in need of an online-dictionary.
ok, so i want to play for a minimum money (which is 200 kr). i have 100 mbps connection (and in denmark) but for all day long i cannot login to danskespil! when i could then the connection is either being reestablished during the game or totally lost. ok, whatever. i manage to connect without issues at midnight. i start playing. there are players (bots actually) who play on all of the 9/9 cashgame tables. how is that even possible? or take this for an example: whenever i raise this guy raises me 4 times! but whenever i fold he also folds. how fucking random is that? or how about this: i have QQ/KK/AA i raise half my chips or all in then this guy (bot) calls with hearts A9 and gets a bleeding flush! not once, not twice....every time! i mean it is so obvious that this site is rigged. what really baffles me is that this site is supposed to be danish government's official and regulated the one and only online poker site! jesus christ man. if denmark, which is one of the least corrupted countries, does this i don't even wanna know about the rest of 'em. keep away from this site and possibly also the rest of 'em. if you wanna play poker go play it in casino with real people not with fucking bots!
dhl promises to deliver in a day, when you look at their time calculation shit in their website (köln-københavn). but oh no, it's been 3 days and the tracking status is still the same. if i knew, i wouldn't have paid double and used deutsche post.
got my package the day after! also good job on the gls side.
Apparently Scubastore doesn't care about bad reviews!! I have ordered a few items over time, and they have arrived within a week or so - that's okay. BUT if you need help, don't try to contact custormer service, cause that's a WASTE of time!! I had a question on a particular product they had in stock - according to their website! In Scubastores reply they wrote: This product is not for sale on our web page. I responded by mailing them a link to there own website, with a follow up question - Scubastore never responded! I have tried mailing them several times to get guidance and recommendations on other products - never heard anything!
Det er et super site med mega god service og hurtig levering!
Det er bare en god oplevelse at handle hod smartgirl
Waited for almost one a half month for a game, when it came it was not the right version. Zavvi don't care! Order number 34279176
I ordered a TV and mounting bracket on a Friday night. I got a call Monday afternoon confirming the order and delivery address. Will receive the TV the next day. The ONLY improvement could have been that they worked over the weekend and delivered the goods Monday. But that is wishful thinking in Denmark. All in all, will recommend others to do business with Cinemagic. No question.
Not one single problem the whole way through. Am about to place another order. :-)
Ordered a book that was in stock  in the end of july 2012. After 1 week no book, then I called the company. They had a lot of excuses and promised me that they would send the book the same day. It's 8 months ago, still no book. Don't buy anything here!
UnoEuro provides a fast and reliable hosting solution, for a great price. Many other cheap webhosts (and even more expensive ones) cannot match the response time of neither the UnoEuro servers, or services. Additional services include nice 1-click installers for common CMSs, and fast response time from the (mostly) really polite support personal. I would recommend them to a friend any day!
I ordered one day in the morning and received my goods the next day. Fast and effective. T. Rasmussen.
I've only experienced positive things concerning my purchases at Army Star. Only minus has been a bag, which was apparently out of stock at the supplier's, and consequently deleted from my order at some point - however, that was force majeure to some extent. In sum, good service and good quality products as far as I can tell.
Det er var super at handle hos SPORT24. Kan varmt anbefales.
alt i alt en god oplevelse at handle med denne hjemmeside.
fin service god pris for min gamle bil og super glad for min nye bil alt i alt er jeg godt tilfreds
Armystar's customer service is practically non-existent. When I called they never answered, only got a machine telling me to use the email. When I wrote them on the email, I got an auto-response telling me to call them... Yeah, kinda circular ain't it.
Det var et total KOMPLETT forløb at handle med jer
God price and quality balance, just annoying that it us must to keep an eye on the mms options, as they must be changed everytime iphone restarts and software updates.
The 18/10/2012 I got a air/water heat pump installed by the Danish company Varmepumperiet. After the installation I called Varmepumperiet because the heat pump was very noisy. They later send out another technician whom solved the problem within the order a free off charge.
I use Google for every ting. What ever I want to find I use Google. It is the best.
Have ordered from this website +10 times, and they never disappoint. The clothes are as pictured, and the sizes are right. The shipping is fast and the few times when I have had to send it back, it was free and easy to do! They have excellent customer service. I will for sure continue to order from their website. Thumbs up.
Det er en god hjemmeside der er let at finde  rundt i ..
Det var bare en rigtig god oplevelse at handle med Gucca.
Love the mix of products and that I don't have to trudge through gazillions of products every time! Especially liked the balm, the oil and the sunscreen. Haven't used the eye cream yet though and probably won't use the corrector that much but its a welcome addition to my soon to be toxin free make-up kit. The sunscreen bottle is a bit small, but then I am using it for myself and the kids! Good work and keep it up!
I am very happy with the service at sejsdyner. I got exactly what I ordered and very quickly too!
alt ok, men har set at i er for dyrre,ellers alt ok.

I got my package pretty much the day after I ordered, and with it came some extra little things that really made my day :)
I rented a Ford Focus at Goldcar last week on contract 6380513. I paid 110EU for a full tank of Diesel (53L tank - a full tank at a gas station costs app. 70 EU)). I asked the employes at Goldcar a simple, but essential question:  "Will I get a full refund if I return the car with a full tank?". The answered "More or less" and "Trust me"... SO the 1 star given will be upgraded to at least 4 stars if I get a full refund - minus 2-3L used to get to Goldstar at the airport. Otherwise it will remain a 1 star experience with Goldstar and a newer returning customer. 10.4: With the answer given below from Goldcar - I have been cheated, like many others as I can see on Trustpilot. If Goldcar was honest, they would have told me about Flex-Fuel and - 28€ for services costs (not-refundable). I cannot recommend Goldcar to anyone and I will newer use this unreliable company again. Unfortunately I have given Goldcar one star to much.
http://www.peachguitars.com has everything I want to buy. I have only bought once and it was a really good experience. I have already begun to consider multiple purchases. I have only one wish and that would be free delivery. So I would frequently receive some good products to Denmark.
really good experience that I can recommend. From order to delivery went there 4 days. Steen arenshoej Denmark
Proshop has been very fast with their service. Proshop has been my number one choice, when it comes to shopping for computers, hardware, phones and such. I have never been disappointed with their service and I am sure I won't be in the future. The only complaint I have is that, it sometimes take too long for them to get their goods in storage.
Ok X x x x x x x x x x
Solsidens Dyrehandel or in daily talk: "Den Grønne" is a very nice shop, with friendly staff, good guidance and a great stock. Always a pleasure. A free cup of coffee is also nice to drink, when you are investigating for things that you cannot live without ;)
I bought a Moskito Fly blanket for riding for only 35 EURO. I'm very satisfied with the quality of the blanket and the fit. They even offered free shipping to Denmark and I received the blanket within three working days :-) So I would definitely recommend Pferdedecken Shop. They should have six stars if that was possible!
Hurtig levering - mangler dog en forsendelsesmail med track & trace
I have been a customer at LF for many years, but my experience with this company has been poor the last year and I have not used the company for a while. I saw recently the traceable shipping option, and I will therefore give LF a second chance. But ... I have placed my order (31477708) on 6.september, and I have chosen and paid for "International Tracked Delivery" (4-9 working days). I received confirmation for dispatch the 08/09/13. When I try to track my shipment on TheHutgroup own tracking page (16 days after dispatch), I get this message: "No item could be found for the posting date you Indicated. Please check the information you entered " I have contacted LF, and got a tracking number for the courier company VNL, this number is wrong, it refers to an order from 3 September. I have contacted LF again , and got a new tracking number, this time for Post Denmark. Post Denmark has only the information that shipment is abroad, and they can not see what courier will deliver it to Denmark. It is very frustrating and annoying that shipping and customer service does not work. LF has not yet responded to my last message. I will in the future choose a company that can deliver the items within a reasonable time limit, and without I need to worry me if I get my shipment and without I waste my time!
Selv med en fejlbestiling fra min side er alt i top
Be aware that the final price for a ticket bought by Bravofly is a lot higher than you have to pay if you use the f.x. Ryanairs homepage directly. You can't get a detailed reciept so tha ýou can see what you paid for. Don't ever use this Company they parasite on other established and wellknown homepages.
Det er super service man får og de har hurtig levering
Great website to find all sorts of items. But something really bad about the website is all the fraud. I have experienced it twice, that i bought something, but never got it.
fantastisk service gang på gang denne butik lever i den grad op til den service de lover,,,
It  is a very fine quality and the product was sent to Denmark very very fast. My Spartan Traxxas is the best RC boat I got, and the boat is very elegant and also easy to sail with. I am 100% satisfied and comfortable with this firm.
i have been a member for almost 2½ year. A very nice site for gays, lesbians and TS and allmost whatever you would like to come into contact with, on our side of the fence. Like many is asking fore, an app for smartphones, would be a nice feature to have on site. The site has some few foults and theres allways room for improvement, but normally there a quickly taken care of, so the support is in general nice and fine. To top it all, i also got 2 extra days as a present because of my birthday, very nice touch Peter :).
Sunday and my computerbattery will not load - I fill out the form at Bærbar.com around 5 o'clock sunday afternoon. Less than 48 hours later my computer is powered and ready for work :-)
Easy to book an Emirates flight, but they keep on sending the spam.
I had purchased many elctronic goods online. What I like most is various options to recieve the purchased item. The website is very easy to use. I never had any bad experience with them. One positive feedback could be, when an item is delivered home, the mentioned timings are 8-16. But, it could be very nice, if you can send us sms or give 2 hour time slot instead of waiting for complete day.
When I wanted to buy a car, I had a lot of confusion about new/used, brand, benzin/diesel. I had visited mitsubushi show room in Herlev and I got a good price for a colt. The sales man was very friendly and I had already recommended this showroom to one of my friend, who also bought a car from them.
They have wide varities of toys for the kids and my kid loves to go to this shop especially one in Gentofte. I hate to go here becuase, it is impossible to bring my kid out from the shop :). They are cheap compare to other stores in Copenhagen. When we want to buy a toy, we only think about Toys Rus..
I var for længe om at flytte mit nr over til jer
Ordered a Tefal steam iron - product arrived within 2 days and was as described - Unbelievable price
The gift is to my son. He will get to christmas. I hope he will be happy for this gift.
Item was cheaper than other web shops or high street shops, and with free delivery made it all the better. Fast delivery and well packaged, thank you
For three days I have been trying to book tickets for the Alhambra in Granada, but I keep getting the same reply: Due to an unforeseen error etc. Ticketmaster seems to have a monopoly on online tickets which makes things worse. And contacting Ticketmaster Spain is not possible - is it a good idea to block customers from contacting you and telling you how to improve your services? Esben
It was a very goog buy, the items were as expected and I got them delivered 24 hours after ordering them. I highly recommend them.
Alt er bare helt i orden når man handler med Granny Smith
sku jo bare bruge et micro sd card, what too worry
Det er let Det er hurtigt Det virker Det er smart
Det var dag til dag service hvad mere kan man bede om, fik en mail at de afsendt min ordre samme dag som jeg bestilte. Det var perfekt.
Det var en god oplevelse - levede op til mine forventninger.
Alt som jeg har bestilt hos Apple er leveret som aftalt.
The tracking system could be easier to figure out, but other than that a great site and shopping experience
Serial no. hassle: I ordered online, but couldn't remember my serial no. which is not recorded anywhere other than your internal records. I received a confirming email with Ordrebekræftelse Ordre nr. 84274 But it didnt work, so I called your office and they entered the serial nr. BUT THEY COULDN'T SAVE IT IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT I DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM NEXT TIME. I was assured that if I entered and saved the information on the order site it would be saved for when I use it next time, but this is clearly nonsense - it only works when ordering.
there are hundreds and thousands web-shops in Europe - but not every one is doing what they can to satisfy customers - Passiontec is definitely one of the 'good people' :-) they not only matched the price for the speakers I was looking for - they GAVE me a batter one (best I could get) e-mail support: great! every time I had a question/query - they get back to me almous immediately with useful answers from what I have experienced I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Passiontec to others and I will most definitely turn to them next time I will be on lookout for product/products I will be interested in
This is COMPLETELY UNACCAPTABLE and is FRAUD. I have ordered with this firm before, the haircolors are fine and everything has been deivered. But now I placed an order on the site at the end of August http://www.danielfield.com/, have paid of course, and still have not received the order at the end of September. I have sent them 3 mails, and tried to call numerous times, but have received no answer, and the calls on the contact phone stated on the website are simply not being answered, no matter which part of day I call. It's too bad I don't know where I can report them in the UK: Maybe will do some research and will. And you at Daniel Field can be sure that this is not the only social media that I will post this on.
mega god bank at have som jeg er meget glad for
My first time ive bought Bitcoins, and i ended up ordering for 10 Dollars at first, and then 100 dollars after.. Nice and safe and as a newbie with no deep knowledge to Bitcoin i felt good about the deal. Hands up for BitcoinNordic!
A small challenge with updating the website in relation to sold-out item. However customer service was quick to respond and come up with alternative proposals. Fast delivery given the product is delivered from the UK to Denmark.
I bought 3 x FLUVENVET 60G for my Chickens who has all the symptoms on throat worms. In Denmark, where I live, you'll have to consult a veterinarian if your animals needs medicine but with the cost of at least 100 pounds for the consultation PLUS the cost of medicine this would be a total waste of money and therefor we normally slaughter the chickens when those worms reaches them. But then I found this webshop selling Fluvenvet at a low cost so I decided to order 3 treatments just to be sure that we get rid of the worms once and for all. The product was just added to their food as described and now we will just have to wait and see how they look by the end of next week. Shipping was a little bit expensive (24 pounds to Denmark. Shipped as a "Signed for..." letter) but if you split the costs over three treatments then it is okay I think. Shipment came only 4 days after I placed the order! That is fast! Overall I had a great experience with this company and I can highly recommend it to everybody.
They answered all my questions, made sure that I was put in touch in the right person. There wasn't any of this speaking with person number five/ten. First class customer service, better than some that I have met before. Intend to spread the word about their products and shopping site. Where I come from, word of mouth is the best advertisement. Annika was a pleasure to speak with, very interested in making sure that I received the stockings I wanted.
Rack for the oven was put to use shortly after arrival home. Have been very pleased with the service and will keep you in mind, should we need assistenance in the future. In these days, you are aware of the people that are short-changed by alot of crooks on the internet. Will pass the word on about the good service to our friends. Vicki Greve
Totally annoying that you need to reload the site every time I returned from a peak at a designers work. I have waited for hours to receive an activation mail - still haven't got it. After I deciding to use my private Facebook profile to login and buy a service I was rerouted to the payment site... So, now i actually don't know if I have payed or not. I have logged off and turned to 99 Designs here things runs smoothly!
God hjemmeside, de laver bare for tit om i design og funktioner!
Det var bare perfekt - og god venlig service - her handler jeg fremover
Very easy to use web site, kept informed about package status.
I have absolute no complaints. Recommend them to everyone ! :-)
Ordered an HDMI cable one day had it the next. And it's alot cheaper than in the stores.
I wanted to transfer one of my numbers to lyca, but nobody seems to read the mails they get at cs@lycamobile.dk. I resent my transfer form, but still no reply, no feedback whatsoever. Today I canceled my transfer request. Probably the third email they will never read or bother to respond to.
apple is an excellent company that provide some great products
I love shopping at scuba store, so many great items at a good price. I often save quite some money compared to the local dealers here in Denmark. And the shipping is nice and easy, never had any problems.
During time, I have purchased running equipment at Loebeshoppen.dk, and every delivery has fully lived up to what I expected. Always rigth item, and the best - the order is alway delivered next day, if I place my ordre before 12. If you contact Loebeshop.dk by mail, you alway get a professionel supervision. My best recommendation to Loebeshoppen.dk.
Altid hurtg med at sende din ordre . Det er bare super god service ;-)
I recently acquired a LP player and I first ordered  4 LPs. The first order was taking a long time as one of the records was not released yet. In the meantime I ordered another 4 LPs where I knew there would be long delivery. But just a couple of days later they wrote me to tell me that they were ready to send me all 8 records! There's something about receiving these babies that bring such an incredible joy. I know other people will relate. All in all, awesome service, very nice webshop, I'd like to see the option to pick up deliveries at the store in order to avoid shipping costs - maybe it is possible? The prices are the best on the market and the packaging of the product very thorough, with some discs having an extra protection sleeve - much appreciated. Definitely not the last time I'll order there! Having seen the Trustpilot reviews before buying was definitely a big +++.
Everything went smooth when ordering and paying the subscription. I have been in contact with their customer support once - that was a very pleasant experience as well..
I just bougth a scooter from Pixmania.de through eBay. I was sent but did not arrive for a week. Then contacted pixmania that refused to do anything unless i signed a document that stated that i was not allowed to contact my bank for a refund. The agreement on eBay said nothing of theese extra conditions and if it did not arrive I would not give up my rigths. Pixmania then kept insisting on the signed document and did nothing. I finally contacted the transport company myself that was kind enough to find it somewhere at get it to me. it ended up taking 13 days Pixmania still have done nothing The problem is that pixmania tries to get customers to abandon their rigths after the deal has been made!
For companies using Facebook as page the new timeline has reduced the value of Facebook significantly - Why would Facebook want to reduce our incentive to do facebook marketing by removing our ability to design our own pages as we want to? We used to direct our customers to the welcome page with QR codes on all promowear etc. now we are directing them to our homepage instead and have been forced to work with plugins on the page instead of running directly on Facebook - what a shame! Wanting to decide for the user and alway knowing what is best is a Microsoft thing - why do you want to go down that road?
The prices were good to start with, but they were raised by a few % in a week?! I was not contacted with the information that the black WD Passport 120GB that I ordered can not be delivered any more, and it was still offered on the web site?! The customer support was helpfull. The delivery was quick.
I purchased a groupon voucher for a photo book. There were several technical issues in the beginning where first my photo book (that I had spent 6 hours creating) disappeared and afterwards I couldn't log in. First time I wrote to printerpix, I didn't hear anything for 10 days and when I heard something, I had to resend my first e-mails. After another 3 weeks the technical problems were solved (e.g. it was the communication that was slow , probably not the problem solving), but now the voucher had run out. During this time, I had asked printerpix to confirm that the voucher could be prolonged in 4 seperate e-mails, but they never mentioned it when they wrote back to me (before after the voucher had run out). Since then, I have contacted them 5 times and have only had one response (1,5 months ago) asking me to send the voucher to them. So now I don't have a voucher, I don't have the product and I have spent 6 hours creating the photobook and probably the same amount of time communicating TO Printerpix... Really bad value for money. I cannot recommend this company.
De har de bedste ting - og de har utrolig god service
We love Amazon.co.uk in my family. Most things are cheaper than in Denmark, and when buying for over 25 £ from Amazon itself the shipping for Denmark is absolutely free. Most recent products we have bought is a certain kind of (brand name) brush for our dog, a device for cleaning bike-chains, a replacement for a broken silver necklace, KitchenAid-attachments and a Giro bikehelmet. All brand-name items that are just cheaper on Amazon co.uk than in Denmark - and delivered directly to the office where I work. It just couldn´t be easier. One time there was a problem with a third-part seller who shipped the product directly from Korea - which meant that we had to pay taxes etc getting it into Denmark. Amazon.co.uk immediately solved the problem, and we got a refund for the extra expenses.
Never had any problems and it's a great way for international payment
Ordered a new pair of cycling shoes. They sent some used shoes. Immediately contacted the seller who apologized and asked me to return the shoes. Seller is now demanding that I have to pay to return the shoes. Biggest scam ever. Never again.
det er 4 gang jeg har handlet hos av cables intet at klage over
Purchased on the internet and everything went smooth and well - I received my purchase after a few days - no troubles and the size was like in the table on the homepage
Nothing bad to say about these guys. I got what i paid for.
I have eaten here many many times and have always found the staff friendly and the healthy food selection exceptional. Nadias is a victim of it's own success. At certain times the queues are very long and although the staff work very rapidly it can be a little frustrating standing in a line for 10 minutes when you only have 30 minutes lunch break. Good value for money and a healthy alternative to the local burger bars!
Bought a 42" Philips lcd TV today. Model was the last in the shop and from 2011 (salesman said it had been in their storage room and only found last week and had been on display in the shop for the last 5 days only). I specifically asked the salesman if the TV had been previously owned or repaired. He checked the computer and assured me it had not and that I was getting a new TV for a good price (DKr 5.500,00). TV was packed in the original box (s/n matches that on TV). At home unpacked my new TV and it worked straight out of box. A little later I looked through the documentation. Imagine my surprise to find a letter from Stofa to a lady in Aalborg mixed in with the guarantee and user manual. There was also a receipt for an unspecified repair to the TV. On Monday I will be speaking to Fona and will update this post.
Product ordered late previous day - arrived next day. Clear and concise web page and payment. Not the first time I have ordered from ProShop and it certainly will not be the last! Great service.
very fast delivery. I have recieved my phone 2 days after ordering :)
Ordered a couple of cables on Friday afternoon - arrived Tuesday as expected. Not the most exciting write-up, but excellent service in my experience.
When I asked why I keep getting logged out the reply I got was that, "because sometimes it happens that you keep getting logged out".
Ordered a garden shed, they tried to deliver it two days before they said they would. They then said if I wanted it redelivered I would have to pay. I had to threaten to cancel the order in order to get them to redeliver without charge. The shed - a Ketter plastic thingy - is fine.
Not every Interflora florist delivers excellent quality every time - and sometimes the value of what is delivered isn't great, but on this occasion the quality and freshness of the flowers was excellent.
Det er en leg at have et on fone abonnement
I got an SMS from you that put me in a total panic - we live in the middle of nowhere with very bad mobile signal so we RELY on email and skype and normal land line phones. So when I get an SMS telling me that soon I can PICK UP my parcel when I have ordered it to be delivered by the the post I was pretty pissed off. I would have to drive 35km each way to the nearest collection point. In addition I could not track and trace my parcel direct on my IPHONE SMS by double click as I can with UPS. Anyway it was OK in the end, it came by post after all. But why not send me an email to track and trace? At least give me a choice if I want SMS or email? Some SMS messages I never get until I leave by car and drive to town,
Det var en god oplevelse Vi har set de to film De var fremragende
I'm very happy with the purchase and service, I have got through Lenson
god forklaring der er mere pulver i originale toner end i demo som er med i pakken med printer
hvad mere kan jeg sige en jeg tit handler hos dem
Hi In all honesty, I am dissapointed with the product I purchased from you (Smart Latino calling card for 100kr). The reasons are: I do not have a fastline at my place, so I have to call from my cellphone which runs on callingcards as well, so everytime I need to call to Panama, I must have credit on my cellphone, and even though there is talking time on the smart latino, which means that the phonenumber you have to dial for accessing the service is not free, as a result I cannot keep on talking because the cellphone credit ran out... so it is like double paying for calling home - so in my case buying this card is not smart at all. The quality of the phone call itself it is not good; in fact it is annoying because we have difficulties hearing each other and to make matters worst there is like a delay on the conversation, so you cannot really follow the conversation "on real time". All and all, I must tell you  I will not buy this product ever again and I will not recommend it to anyone. It is a shame, because I think the idea is very good, but it has been a very awful experience and somehow a waste of money for me. My recommendation to you, work harder for improving this product. Have a nice day Jill
Was recommended by the hardwarestore to use their product line to waterproof an outdoor balcony. Spent a ton of money and it only lastet a year. Then the water was pooring through. Schluter sent out a smart a.. Sales guy who told me he could see my problem, but it wasnt due to fault of their products. Had to remove every part of Schlüter products, and now it is waterproofing the junkyard!!! Ended up using an EPDM liner. Bullit proof AND watertight!!!!
jeg har købt min ting hos matas webshop de var hurtig med at sende min ting
Have ComX for more than 5 years, and never had a problem, it was down for 2 day, we got the month and the month after for free :)
Good homepage, quick delivery - only one nuisance, I could not write as a comment to leave the package in the garage, so I did not have to go to the post office.
men ikke den billigste bank at " handle med "
On The 1st Oct i ordered Prometheus 3D Collectors edition to 199 kr, which was a massive 100kr cheaper than anywhere else, for a 4 disk set it's really cheap. Pakage was sent on the 2nd and recieved on the 3rd. Excellent service except the disks have Finsk subtitles but that is no matter cause i'm English. Blockbuster needs to check what versions they are selling cause the outer sleeve of the set is in danish but the dvd case inside is finnish. Otherwise perfect, will order again when prices are that crazy good.
Bought a HTC One X with Pow 2 Timer. Not really sure about anything. I wanted to pay the phone over 24 months. I ordered on the 3/7/2012 and got the phone quickly which was great. But i got no email telling me the phone was on the way or no email about mobiltillæg. I am now unsure if a bill will be on the way charging me full price for the phone because according to Selfservice i'm not in binding and don't have any mobiltillæg. What is going on ? It would be crazy to charge me full price for the phone without contacting me. I would not have bought the phone if i had to pay full price. I ordered a phone with afbetaling, thats what it says on my Ordrebekræftelse.
So it came a day later than we expected. Apart from that, no problem except that the user instructions were in French! NOT our language.
I wiated in all day to receive the package. But it eventually came over an hour late! In 5 more minutes I would have left home so missed the package!
Samsung black toner cartridge. Came as promised and the progress emails were very good
I was cold called by a representative from this company two years ago and after some discussion of the advantages of a business account, I agreed to change my provider. I have had nothing but trouble since. At every turn Telenor have shown themselves to specialise in deception of customers both in terms of price, services and locking you into a service that you are trying to get out of. Firstly, I see no sign that there is any advantage to having a business account. And then there is a long list of irritations and poor service that I have spent a lot of time and energy on whilst having them as provider. I have now been informed that there is a 90 day notice on cancelling my subscription, which is definitely not what I was told by the seller when I made a verbal agreement to join the company. I have known since the first week that I joined this provider that I wanted to get out of the contract, but was sure that I was cancelling the contract in good time by phoning in today, a month and a half before the end of the binding period. After a short discussion with customer services, who informed me that they could cancel the contract immeditely, I got an email informing me of the 90-day period of notice. This is how it has been throughout my time with them as a customer. The right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. Or pretending not to know, I am not sure which. Never, ever again. Be warned. They are not at the top of the list of really shitty excuses for a business in Denmark for nothing
Found an interesting offer, ordered and picked it up. The guy at the pick up was fast, smiled and help all the way. And by the way the wine is great !
Bought four new Bilstein B8 shocks for my VW up! at a very reasonable price. I didn't expect them to have the shocks in stock, but the shocks shipped out the following day! I'm very pleased with the experience, although I would like to receive an e-mail notification when the goods are shipped. Will definitely use MK again :)
Det var bare en god oplevelse jeg havde med min handel.
Fin fin fin fin fin fin fin fin fin service
Initially, I was dissapointed with this company, but now when I see that they care about their customers, I decided to rate it with 4 stars. I will wait until I get my package and if everything is OK, will rate it with 5 stars! Thanks Nicolaj for the feedback. It is highly appreciated!
The very best shawarma you can eat! not too happy staff from time to time though.
why do ppl buy food from such a disgusting place? I do get if you can't find any other place to eat, but why would you want to eat there? yuk!
High educated teachers, nice facilities, well connections and overall pretty excellent college. Though the administration isn't optimimal enough. The staff I believe have too few according to the work which needs to be done.
Convenient site, which helps you to find any electronic product for the right price. :)
Nice site, easy to get around, though the percentage charges for the sellers are quite high.
I ordered from SBG without really having any knowledge about their services but since I could pay through a trustworthy e-commerce company, I knew it must be a reliable company. I paid for my products and had them delivered within the promised 14 days. The products were as described and the service throughout the whole process was good/informative. I'd gladly buy from SBG again.
has never had any problems, and i love their great offers :)
Its a good shop, they have a lot of plants to choose from. Very fast shipping once the items are shipped. Plants are packed very good, so I dont doubt they only had one shipment of plants ever die while being shipped. I would like that they didnt require you to buy for x amount befor they will accept your order.
Ordered one day received two days later, Transport could be followed all the way until arrival Perfect service
Recess.nl is a brilliant online music-shop. No arguing there. Have ordered from them twice and has never faced any problems whatsoever. The one thing I have to point out, is the prices and the VAC (eg. for Danish customers) which is extremely high compared to other foreign music-shops. The price level bump my rating to "only" four start, out of five.
I ordered a protection film for my Xperia Arc, and recieved a product with no directions about how to place it safely on my screen. I did it the wrong way. Company admits, that there are NO directions with the product but refuses to send a new product or refund.
No problem here :) I found just the glasses I wanted and the price was also the lowest here. Recommended!
Ordered an iPad cover late afternoon Thursday before Christmas, was a bit worried that it wouldn't be delivered on Friday but oh yes it was! Thank you!
I loved shopping at billigvoks.dk. The prices are amazing compared to my hair dresser, and the delivery was superfast. I also enjoyed the lollipops! :)
I've ordered twice from naturoghelse.dk, both transactions were smooth. There were a wrong product in my second order, but the naturoghelse's sales claimed the fault and sent me the correct product right away, even before me sending the back the wrong one. Super Service, fast delivery helpful personnel.
Det er super nemt at handle i SuperSellerS, de har mange gode ting til brig i butikken.
De har bare alt til billige penge og der service er bare i top
Bought tickets to Sagrada Familia. I subsequently found out that I paid a premium of 8.5 EURO more for the tickets compared to the price at the official online shop. I would recommend that you do NOT buy tickets here, but directly by the entertainment / museum !!
If you need Gillette blades at a great price this is the place to go!
For memory cards this is the place to shop. Very reasonable prices and faster than Superman delivery. I recommend this company for how a business should be run.
I had no  problems with Befro and will do business with them in the future.
Vichy Homme products are cheaper than the Apotek and delivery is on time. I would like to see a larger selection of Vichy Homme products available. For example there is a spray deodorant that has a refreshing smell, not overwhelming, suitable for daytime use.
Allan Clark Sweatshirt BORDEAUX M Through past experience I have now learnt my size with various brands, and this medium was a perfect fit.
I had a few questions before purchasing, maybe a bit silly, but the staff at PioneerShop were very patient, and now I have a very good pair of Pioneer speakers.
I wanted an old fashioned manual lawn  mower, that is just a mower without all the bells and whistles. I found it at a very reasonable price and now I can burn 500 calories an hour and have a lawn with dark and light stripes, just like a cricket field.
Just as I think I need to save money, so a get a call from "3" always with good news. They keep an eye on ones use and then arrive with a solutiion that keeps me happy.
You pay a low price for a quality VPS, and I've experienced free upgrades twice. I write to support for a couple of questions, I get a very well described answer within 10 minutes. (I just wrote one and got a answer in less than 2 minutes on a sunday :O)
Fast delivery, but pretty smashed delivery box and lazy delivery provider. It all shines back to the seller, which is the reason for 4 out of 5 stars.
Den service de lover , er også den man oplever ! Thomas steffensen
Rodes er super god! God service er en kvalitet som rodes i den grad har!
Everything was like they said on their website and it didn´t take long before I recieved the shirt
Always on time and good delivery (from the local flower shops used). Good user interface on the web site.

The service is is great, you can always get in contact with the CEO and the work that is being done is ready on time! Deadlines are held and the prices are very reasonable as well
Fra start til slut var det hele tiden den nødvendige information for at få en god ferie.
I´ve been around on different photosites and this one appealed to me because: 1 It´s free! 2 No ratingsystem amongst the members, no "Superusers" vs. "Beginners" and no "Trial-period" before you are accepted on equal terms. 3 Relatively easy navigating through pictures, equipment, forum-threads. 4 25 uploads pr. week in 400 Kb 5 Very helpful attitude from more skilled photographers. 6 Lots of competitions on a playful level, arranged and administered by the members. 7 Lots of photoarrangements of both tutorial and social character, also arranged by the members. 8 Pretty fast upload and showing of the pictures. 9 Many interesting photorelated topics and hot photonews in fora. 10 An easygoing style amongst the members. 11 A good buy and sell function. 12 Adds and banners kept on a minimum of annoyance. I can only recommend this site for beginners, as well as for the more advanced and professional photographers, since there will always be someone that can teach you or give usefull advice on nearly any photorelated topic, and gladly do so! :0)
Ordered a Garmin 910 late Saturday, received confirmation right away. Received a mail update late Sunday that my order was ready to be shipped and it was delivered to my address Tuesday morning. Faster service cannot be expected. And for the goods itself, all as expected. I like the no-nonsense way of dealing.

Google.com is my best engine for search. I would recomend this to anyone
I have now bought the Alove Vera products for a while from Vera Cura and I have nothing but great things to say about their service. I always received the products right away and in great condition. Very professional. The products seem of good quality as well. I definately recommend!
Det er en god oplevelse som privatperson at handle med Drinkworld
Bath & toilet facility need to have a quality check. Broken items in the service buildings must be fixed. /ivan
I just love the very creative and cool shop, and it is an easy way to shop from the whole world ( or a big part of it ) .
Dont deliver items, mail respons is verry bad. after paying you discover the payment is in china yen :((
God info pr mail og hurtig levering alt i alt en god oplevelse at handle hos Elysion
I have just payed 4 x 400 Dkr (apr. 4 x 80 USD) for a ESTA (Visa for USA) that on the official page (which I thought it was) only costs 4 x 15 USD. To my knowledge there is no difference except the STEEP price difference. I have no idea what I am paying the extra 4 x 65 USD for or why there is such a big price difference?!? The only reason I used this page was because I though it was the official page. I do NOT RECOMEND other people to use this page
Købte en DVB-T tuner til min computer - hurtig levering til prisen. Alt i alt en god handel...

German site that sells Katana, Ninja swords, Bokken, armors etc.. And for an OK price. Have bought a Bokken training katana, on Tuesday. as it passes through Paypal takes it a little time. But the dispatch is happening today with DHL. The times I have approached me, there's only gone a few hours before I had answers to my questions. Competent service all the way and can easily recommend the site to people who seek these items ^ ^
jeg er supet glad for de ting jeg her købet
Very impressed with your fast service and delighted with my product. Would not hesitate to order from you again. Thank you very much guys.
The items arrived the next day. Everything arrived as ordered and my children were well pleased to have their cykles repaired for the weekend. thank you, I will use you again :)
they use GLS delivery which ships to your local grocery store -- very nice, I don't have to go to the post office far away if I miss the postman.
Det er godt men er alt for lidt da data i pakkerne
Fed ide . . . . . . . .  :)
Det er første gang jeg handler her. Alt lever op til forventningen.
El Giganten did not know my new computer was last until I notified them. Communication was very basic, no apologies and no urgency to ship the replacement. In the meantime the price offered by El Gigaten has gone down, but as yet no offer of compensation. Very average performance. Highly unlikly to shop with this company again!
I ordered my new mp3-player for over 2 weeks ago i never got it???? I got mails about if i was happy about my new player, but it`s difficult to answer it never came!!! I`m so disappointed and don`t no what to do now...
I've baught A pair of sunglasses 17 days ago. 12 days ago they wrote that they wer in stock at the manufacturer, but I didn't receive them yet. As the glasses should show up 3 days ago and be sent by express from there warehouse right away (if no accident), they should have been here by now. But they are not. So apparently an accident happened, but didn't hear anything form Smartbuyglasses.
Goods came as promised - no problems what so ever
It was really easy ordering products at Thansen. Thought it was a good idea that thansen offered a service where u could have your order sent to a shop of your choice for collection.
I got rid of my cybercity internet after 6 months of nothing but trouble. Fullrate has been working without any issues and the service has been golden. Highly recommended!
In short! I was not satisfiied with the product I received and wrote review below. However, there was no problem returning the  bought item and it is clear that this shop does alot to keep their customers happy. Thank you. BR Rune Jeg har lige købt 2 Lightning to USB kabler - det fremstår INTET sted at det ikke er originale kabler - og det er det IKKE. De har dårlig kombatibilitet og stikket passer ikke 100% til en Iphone 5. Jeg fravalgte bevisdst de steder på nettet med uoriginale kabler og var ud fra billeder og tekst overbevist om det var originale kabler. De kostede da også dobbelt så meget som uoriginale kabler fra konkurrerende virksomheder. Så med andre ord falsk varebetegnelse. RESPOND to WEBSHOPS feedback: Hi Isabella, Thank you for your respond and your call. This alone shows that you take your business and clients serious. However, I have to comment on your feedback. You talk about Apple covers and keyboards etc. I do not really care what other web shops do, as I usually only trade on a few webshops that I trust and have good experiences with. The fact that Apple does not produce the cables themselves are 100% irrelevant – as I told you in the phone this is not unusual. BUT Apple guarantees that their products are alright and live up to a certain standard (otherwise they would not put their name on the cable). You say: “We have no where in our site, product descriptions or pictures hint or try to mislead users to have the impression that we are Apple. As I understand that you are frustrated for we do NOT say what we NOT are.” Well you can simply just say that this is an unoriginal cable (this way you do not have to say what you are not – and it would mislead no one). Only argument for not stating that this is an unoriginal item is that sale would perhaps decrease! Futhermore, the picture of the product on your website is NOT identical to the actual product you sent. The picture of the cable on your web site is white (as Apples cables), and the cable you sent me is grey (copy). This misleads the customer to think you get something else than you actually pay for. Last but not least – what happens if cables from you webshop breaks the apple item because it is not a 100% match (because it is not)? Again thank you for your feedback – I will return the cables and buy original cables – as I fear the cables from you will damage my Iphone. Rune
er altid glad for at handle hos smartkids. alt er i orden
Det er et godt sted at handle - med hurtig levering
The product is of great quality, the purchasing process was easy and straightforward, and delivery fast!
Og levering og leverings info op til var helt i top
The service is very reliable and quick. But the description of the items is not exactly adequate or sufficient. In the end, all that I have bought from Conrad Elektronik was wrong, even though I really wanted it. The prices are right, the quality is right as well... but the satisfaction is very low...
All went quickly and with no problems. The item was sent very quickly, I received an SMS that it is being delivered soon, and indeed it came. I bought a 2 TB hard drive. It works excellently, and the price was absolutely unbeatable (cheaper than anywhere in the world!). What a store!!!
Best possible prices. Easy homepage. I ordered things yesterday and received them already today! It just can not be better!!!!! THis is what one would expect from a respectable company. I am absolutely satisfied.
I have bought via webapoteket the first time. It seems like this is the only place where I can buy Decubal-though it is very expensive. After ordering, I received my order within a day, max. two. I am satisfied with the service. And the home page is extremely easy to use.
It can not be better!!!!!! Not only it arrives in a matter of a day or two, but it is packed so well!!! It is the best online service I know. And - what is also VERY important, the prices are the best possible, and the shipping is either acceptably low or gratis if one buys not that much. jala-helsekost is absolutely unbeatable!!!!!!!!!
I received my hard drive very quickly, and all works as it should. The hard drive is perfect, just as I wanted it. I can not be happier. It all went easily and smoothly.
Det har været en fornøjelse at handle med SmartGuy - alt som lovet. Kris
Hurtig god god levering af en fantastisk iphone, som i den grad lever op til mine forventinger
Excellent service and fast delivery, will be happy to return for future purchases - transparent and fair mode of delivery and delivery charges.
Great online shop for craft brewers. Very nice and up-to-date selection of fresh hops. Fluid yeasts are also in abundance. This is definitely the shop you keep coming back to if you live in Scandinavia and love brewing.
Var en super nethandel oplevelse , dag til dag levering ! Fedt !
Det var en god oplevelse at handle med Elgiganten, levering til tiden.
Smartgirl lover aldrig mere end de holder - har været meget glad for at handle med firmaet
I have only placed one order with them to be picked up in store, when I fly over. The order consisted of two items. Total, incl. tax $30.50. Nothing out of the ordinary there. When viewing the order inside their system it says a total of $3.26 (one item still being over $24!) Now my credit card has received the bill at $28.45. I am just an engineer. I am not good enough at math to figure out how they do it! Their e-mail help desk is not much help! Even when replying to their reply, a new person comes along. Again one with no clue. They don't actually read the mail it seems. Half the answers have been in totally different directions from my questions. They do have some good items for sale, however. Maybe next time I simply should hope for the best, show up at the store, and hope they not just ran out.
Website is simple and and the whole experience including short delivery time,  was up to scratch. Especially fond of the posibillity to chat online with a sales person, even in my own language! (Danish). No problem in recommending www.sunglassesshop.com
I exchanged a handful of bitcoins to fiat, and the payment was on my account on time, as promised. You get fast, effective and reliable service!
Real good and fast service I'm very glad that I did my shopping with them A good organized web shop  that is easy and simple to overlook  and trouble-free to  order from, they have fine and reasonable  prices compared to others. They have a first-rate service and very helpfully Legetojforborn.dk has my heights recommendations
Leveringstiden er alt for lang i forhold til den lovede leveringstid...
bare en computertaske, men alt var bare tip top iorden. Kan anbefales.
I ordered a few times from Befro, it is easy, cheaper, quicker and always satisfying services.
we came down to Prag and had almost no problems
Alt i alt en god oplevelse at handle med Jepsen Healthcare.
I bought before form Getmore and keep doing it as much as possible as their service is perfect. I always get immediate order confirmation, good follow-ups and tracking of the order. All this plus that most if the time they are also the cheapest. Cannot ask much more from "getmore" ;-). Thanks
Only took 24 hours for my package to come to denmark Really good service
Det hele forløb fint. Det var alt i alt en god oplevelse.
I can recommend Bestmoney to anyone looking for an insurance! Incredible service for FREE!
We bought 14 Eames chairs of different models and have used them a few months now. It's really good quality, especially for the price!
Lowest prices on RAM anywhere in Denmark. One of the two RAM modules were defective, but the replacement was handledexcellently: Pixmania paid for the return postage and immediately shipped a replacement module. Only problem was that they emailed a broken link to print the UPS label. I had to log into their homepage to print it.
Yourshelter might be cheap, but their servers are unstable and perform like crap. If you report a problem, they don't take it seriously and they don't fix the problems. Wiinyt.dk has been down pretty much constantly now in four days because of yourshelter. They haven't solved the problem, it took them days to respond and they clearly have NO idea how to solve the problems. And it's not the first time this has happen, we have pretty much been struck with downtime each month and every time with slow / useless response from support. At this moment I'm looking for a new host, because this is not acceptable. DO NOT BUY FROM YOURSHELTER.
after 5 months, my Avast! Internet Security suddenly stopped working. after trying for about 30 minuts (i know i don't have a lot of patience, especially when i can't find the problem) i decided to write a support ticket and hope for the best, fearing that it would take for ever after reading some rewievs about slow tech-support. the ticket was submittet at 15:17 (or 3:17 pm) and literally 2 minuts after that, the reply came from Richard Šrank, one of the avast! Technical Support Specialist. after that, it took about 10 minuts to get it up and working perfectly again, and most of that was waiting for the pc to boot and reboot unless somthing drastic changes, i will definentlie be re-subscribeing when my current licens expires
Fantastic products and fantastic service at affordable prices with all the great specials you offer!
Super fast delivery and the sunglasses looked like the pictures. I was very satisfied
It was a such a great experience to buy things using cyclingshop.dk I will for sure recommend it!
Bestilling OK - levering OK - betaling OK - elgiganten OK
Really nice and quick delivery of my TV set. I lacked a bit of informatin on when the delivery would take place and then suddenly, it was there. :-) i bought a Samsung Smart TV which needs a wifi dongle to connect itself on a wifi connection. Too bad Elgigant.dk doesn't sell this product since it's a necessary accessory. I had to struggle a bit to find it and finally got it from Redcoon.dk.
Hi, I ordered too polo shirts for my husband for his birthday. The shirts were too big so I had to bring them back to a Kaufmann shop and they didn't have the polo shirts in the same size. Now I have to order them again and pay for the postage twice. It's not very convenient:-(. In other online stores, it is possible to send the items back if they are not the right size and then order the correct size. It's a pity you can't do this with Kaufmann.dk, otherwise everything else was great....but unfortunately now we don't have to items we wanted.
Goods where as specified and shipping was reasonable and quick
I love this product and use it every day! Once i lost my licens key, and ask for it on email. few minutes later i got it! THANKS for an amazing service and a perfect product that make my day better and easier ;)
s u p e r s e r v i c e
Fast delivery and even a personal follow-up regarding a mistake.
Right so i just ordered my 3rd game from Go2Arena, and i have to say they are awesome. I really don't have much to complain about, other then sometimes their website gets a little messy, or at least that is my opinion. Thanks again!
De lever i den grad op til hvad de skriver :)
ordered coin book and was very pleased for the service i got befoere and after the service.
I have ordered several items. A week after promissed deliverydate nothing was delivered. After several phonecalls, still no delivery. At last they agreed to return all my money, but they did not - having kept a large fee for handling and shipping. Worst experience ever - i feel i got robbed.
Awsome store, great products and fast shipping. I would definitely recommend this store to others.
rigtig god vandkøling til sin pc jeg er glad for at handle hos coolerkit.dk
I (naively?) ordered a GPS assuming it was new/unused. What I got was a refurbished unit (first registered in august 2009) without the possibility to upgrade the included maps. In the webshop,the product was labelled "Updated", without further explanation. The unit is working fine and looks new, but the info. in the webshop could (should) have been more precise.
hands free sæt er leveret til tiden og i fin stand
jeg er super glad for at jeg fik anbefalet at handle med mytrendyphone super god oplevelse
They deliver the products on time and if anything is wrong you just call them and they correct or change the order. We give them our best recomendation.
Det har været let og effektivt at handle med pro golf Scandinavia A/S
De har det på lager man mangler i en hurtig levering
Over the last years I've bought over 100 CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs from Zoverstocks. Even with the shipping it's far cheaper than going to a second hand store or renting them. When I browse through the list of "Used & New" at Amazon.co.uk I always look for Zoverstocks as the first choice. Great place to buy cheap stuff.
al the infotmation of teh product i were looking was clear and acurate. the service fast and delivery without any hassle. excellent service in my opinion
very nice looking wheels. they are very good and the lock make the whole difference
We were to fly with EY 403 from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. First we were told that the flight was 2 hours delayed for unknown reasons..when we finally boarded the flight we waited another hour before take-off. The reason being that we have to wait for 4 passengers i.e. about 250 passengers were further delayed for 1 hour due to 4 passengers. We complained to the crew who told us this has nothing to do with them so they did not feel responsible. The captain of the flight in his first announcement did not even apologise for the delay. when complaining to customer service they call it operational problems which cannot be true as we were waiting for passengers. Checking with officials in Bangkok airport then apparently it is quite normal for the Etihad flights to be delayed. Another small matter that some people on the flight complained about was also that all of  sudden there was a muslim prayer on the  and that I have never experienced that before and quite offensive when you call yourself a global airline then you need prayers for all religions or alternatively no prayers We will NEVER fly Etihad again
If you like to keep it simple then make homepage with Bricksite.com. No longterm cost - here and now functions buy, for slides ect. It is easy to work in the system and the support even if it is the video s or personal support trough email it is thumps up.

We was looking for swimming diaper for baby however nowhere has except swimming pool store and Bilka. Really good offer and so great.
Det er ret simpelt.... what you see i what you get...
They sell books in many categories. It was easy to find the books I was looking for, it was easy to order them and the delivery was fast. They keep your customer information and I am able to what I have purchase and so on. I also contacted them with a question and the response was quick. I had an answer in a few days. The design of the website definitely also attracted me to the site! One disadvantage is lack of information on some of their books. They simply do not have a review on all of them. I had to visit other sites to read about the book before I purchased it on e-lounge.
I travelled from Stavanger to Copenhagen via Oslo.  I arrived two hours early at the airport and saw there were delays so I asked before checking in if my flight was on time, and asked that they put me on an earlier flight to Oslo or direct to Copenhagen.  They assured me that my flight was on time.  It wasn't.  With the result that I missed my flight from Oslo to Copenhagen and had to spend the night in Oslo (on SAS expense).  The explanation was that the flight from Stavanger to Oslo was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft from Spain.  So they DID know when I asked before checking in.  They plainly lied to me!! Anyway - OI was travelling with a golf bag, which I asked that they keep checked in in Oslo and send to Copenhagen with my flight the next day.  However I had to retrieve it and then check it back in, it was obviously too difficult for SAS to figure out that I wanted the luggage delivered with myself in Copenhagen.  So I checked the luggage in and went to the hotel at around 23:00.  I was offered a meal, which was what was left of a buffet at the SAS hotel.  It was not good food after having been left out on hot-plates for several hours.  The buffet had actually closed at that time of night.  They could at least have given me room service or something so I could have gotten some fresh food.  Anyway I got up again at 4:30 the next morning to catch my new flight to Copenhagen, and went to retrieve my luggage.  And waited, and waited.  No luggage.  They had not managed to send my luggage with my flight despite me checking it in 8 hours ahead!  The luggage finally arrived two days later.  They sent it to my house with the message that it would arrive some time between 17:00 and midnight.  So I had to stay home the entire evening to wait for my luggage. I asked at SAS so called "servicedesk" at the airport in Oslo and in Copenhagen regarding claiming my 250€ from SAS because of late arrival in accordance with European aviation regulations, and to pay for my extra parking costs in Copenhagen, but was told to contact customer relations on their webpage.  They could not handle that at the customer service desks.  Figure that one out anyone? I have now written my complaint on the web form, there is no telephone number, no email address, and you get an automatic reply from a "no-reply" address when you send the form.  The message is that they are so slow handling customer complaints that they will not be able to answer in 7 weeks.  7 WEEKS!!!  So I'm still waiting for a reply to my complaint. I used to like SAS.  I have been a regular traveller for many years.  I only have a silver card now, but I have been a gold card member.  In fact, I have chosen to fly SAS over other airlines, like Norwegian, British Airways, KLM and Air France.  After this experience I must say that all my loyalty to SAS has disappeared.  Shame on you.  I can entirely understand that you struggle economically.  Of course people will not fly with you when your customer service is so lousy!

This was not a good car rental experience.  We had to wait almost two hours for our car when we arrived in Paris, and was charged a lot more than we had expected.  If you use these people make sure you read the small type!  They also charged my credit card for the car before it was actually rented (2 months before).  Is that really legal? We turned in the car one day before planned - Europcar, that was renting the car to us - told us we would get our extra insurance fee back for the last day, but AutoEurope refuses.  Europcar refuses to help us since we did not book through them.  We also did not get the extra day's rental back from AutoEurope. Conclusion: Stay away from this company - it is cheaper in the end to rent directly from the rental company.
This whole business is a scam based out of China selling you one thing and sending you another.
People who think SharkGaming systems are Pro, dont know a thing about computer systems. I've been a computer geek for many years, have always built my own machine. Suddenly I got a strange idea. "I want to buy a computer this time." I contacted  Shark to get a deal on a custom-built machine. That I got. I was satisfied and decided to continue with my strange idea. 1. I was promised a GFX card, that suddenly could not be delivered. 2. I was then promised a second graphics card. But when I got the machine, there was a third graphics card installed. :/ 4. After a week I got a new GFX card in the mail, that I had to install :/ 5. I was promised an OC from 3.5 to 4.3. When I got the machine, it was not OC. 6. Delivery was about 4 weeks. 7. The machine cost 15.000kr. 8. I'll never do it again. When you buy a machine for 15,000, you expect no other than top quality from a Pro company. I admit that the equipment in the machine was top quality, but the coppany was unfortunately not.
I can only recommend this shop, as I am very satisfied with the fast respons and delivery.
Everything whent satisfactory and the product works like a charm :-)
A smooth and painless process. Only (small as delivery was free) annoyance was relatively long (7+ days) delivery and that i had to pickup at post office instead of getting delivered.
Super fast service , things are delivered inside time frame . Products are great
Fantastic hotel, right in the middle of town - perfect !! The food is exceptional, an the staff are very polite, including the hotel manager, who's nothing like Basil Fawlty - thank god :-)) I'll certainly be visiting again .....
And i object to being ripped off with their fucking soda prices. Should be illegal !!!
Buy ALL my stuff for both private AND private at "the giant" in Randers. I have always been treated very well by everyone there, have had some really good deals, and am a very happy customer. Cant understand the negative comments on here. You go to Elgiganten cos you're a cheap bastard, and want to pay as little as possible, right? So be prepared, if things dont go as planned. If you want cream on top, then go somewhere else and shop. You get what you pay for, and i'm STILL happy, so there !!!!
As the supplier of both American and British products to Superbest, we, Food From Home feel that they are without doubt THE forerunner within the Danish supermarket sector. In my many years of experience in this business, i am 100% certain that  my decision to supply them with our exciting products, is certainly the right decision. Long live Superbest and all who may sail in her :-))
For vacations and extended week-ends all arround Europe I prefere ECR, they deliver a very good service at a VERY good price - They help you if you recieve some old junk, and have deals that you can understand (no hidden fees etc.) - If they ask for extra assurance etc at the local counter - just say NO, you have what is needed for normal coverage  ;-) I have never seen better prices, so EconomyCarRentals are the one to go for. Please observe, that is is NOT ECR that provide the car, so you can get a dirty old scratched car - This is the rental company you have to speak with. Offen you will not know what to expect, some countries have old rental-cars others brand new. I have had a 350Km new car in Palma and one that probarbly have driven ten times round the earth on Cyprus - Different places, different standards.
I will recommend everyone who is looking for sunglasses to buy them on sunglassesshop.com! The customer service was perfect and i got the sunglasses within a week (Im located in Denmark). So, shop shop shop! They are great :)
Det var en rigtig god oplevelse at handle hos dem god leveringstid
It is easy to navigate, the support know what they are doing (And they are extremely friendly too) and they have an amazing gurantee policy. I have absolutely nothing to complain about when it comes to amazon.co.uk.
Hi, I'm very satisfate, and I will come back to this shop to buy more :)
Det er er let at handle hos jer på nettet.
I downloaded the software Topaz Simplify 4 for a 30 day trial period. The software looks great and would very likely have bought it after the 30 day trial. The software doesn't not work however. It freezes the minute you try to save whatever you have done. It isn't possible to contact Topazlabs unless you buy a program. Will anyone buy a program that does not work ? What is the point of a trial period if you cannot get support when the product doesn't work ! Lousy that the program doesn't work  and even lousier support that you cannot get in touch with ! Room for improvement ? Heaps !
De lever meget godt op til deres slogan jeg har sldrig haft problemer med dem
Det er en Web site der ikke er til at undvære
If you want to return and have a refund, the you Can wait and wait for the refund and nothing happens!! Not even after 30 mails ... Dont shop at fashionqueen.net
I was sceptical about this company because I'd got scammed before buying sunglasses. But I took the chance because I could get a discount through another company. I found the sunglasses from RayBan I wanted so badly and ordered it. I got the discount and two weeks after I received the sunglasses. It was in the original packaging and everything was fine. I'm just waiting to get enough money to buy a new pair at Sunglassesshop.com. Thanks for not scamming me. And thanks for my wonderful sunglasses :)
men de kun ha en dansk supper til dem som ikke er god til go skive på eng
Ordering online and collecting in store is very easy.  Lots of English books to choose from, and I will definitely buy again.
I enjoy shopping on their website... it is much easier to see any new items, and the option to see store stock and instore collection is easy.  Instore collect is made better if reserved online... in the store you will pay the Internet price if the store is more expensive!
Alt i alt en god oplevelse at handle hos Campingnetshop
Rimelig hurtig levering ( 3dage ), men mangler track and trace
Great concept! Really using the Internet's potential to be useful and empowering. Actually, about usefulness -- I personally would put autobutler above Facebook. I got real help in a real life situation, I got to choose (and I did not have to spend time calling all sorts of garages), I got the choice I wanted, I got satisfied by the job done.
I have bought from computersalg.dk for two times. I was attracted by the prices. I received what I expected, within the time I expected, in good condition and packaging. No problems so far.
super god , nen hurtig gør det bare let at købe ting hos jer
with call me really I am not worry about the bill. I travel two three times in the year and always use my mobile in calling and I never got a big amount to bay. I used it while i was in Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Egypt. I like this mobile company and I am not thinking to change it.
I have used Bikebuster several times and always with greqt sucess, products on time and good quality.
Hi all, I can recommend Boligportal.dk to all of you. Previously, I wrote about boligbasen which is a worst website and I wasted my 600 kr. there. But, when I registered on boligportal.dk, I was skeptic because of my previous experience. I can now recommend boligportal.dk to all of you because we are about to visit a house we want to rent and it is right where we wanted it. Even if we don't get the house, no problem - I will extend my subscription on Boligportal.dk because I trust them. At least, we get the phone number of the landlords who we can call. Thank you very much, boligportal.dk for your super job.
After several complaints from customers that they do not make people aware of the need to pay customs duties and taxes on the goods they have now done so you have to pay it along with the order, so that no additional costs. But now I have looked after accordingly receive a bill from UPS (delivery company) more than what the item I bought is worth. I write so to customer service, which denies that it should be possible to pay for customs and taxation. I contact the UPS, and it may well see that I have paid but can not do anything, because Lightingthebox have sent the package in the wrong way. So at this moment I am struggling with an automatically according kundeserivce to get Lightinthebox to pay for their mistakes. The page can not be recommended, even if the commodities are cheap.
wine delivered at time. and it's very good. now I hope my bithday guests agree.

Det er en mega hurtig shop hvor alt bare er godt
You get what you pay for, good chat support and fast handling. When I had to cancel the server I had to pay for one more month?! Why?! They've never told me that at any time, any place!
My product didnt work at all. They told me to contact DBS as made to product, but they couldnt help me. I have now contacted Simmarket again for asking for my money back.... Simmarket wont let me get my money back.... -YES! I AM PISSED OFF!
I have bought several thing on their website for my wife, always good service and quick delivery with UPS.
I ordered a HP Envy printer from Fona.dk on the 22nd of February. I did it at the Fona Amager Centret store, because I had some complications doing it alone at home. I got great help from the staff there. He said it generally takes up to about one week to receive the package. I wrote a mail to the customer service on the 5th of March, because I havent received my printer by then, and the money wasnt minused from my account either. I got a short auto-reply saying the person is on vacation, which made me wonder - is there only one person dealing with customer service at Fona? So the next day I decided to go back to Amager Center to ask where my printer is. At this dato, I have been waiting for 2 weeks. The staff made a few calls, and he told me that I havent received my printer yet, because they are out of stock, and I have to wait until the Fona Stroeget receives it, and they will send it to me. I found the excuse ridiculous, because on the day of ordering the Norrebro and Bronshoj stores (few more I cant remember) had it in stock, and I would have had the option to go there and pick it up, but I wasnt able to do the logistics, therefore I chose to receive the package online. The staff told me it will take about one week until I receive it. The package was delivered on the 12th of March, and I picked it up on the 13th, so basically I had to wait 19 days from the date of ordering until I had my printer in hand. It is not only the length of time I had to wait that Im annoyed about - it is more that they kept me waiting without no information whatsoever. If they tell me on the same date that they are out of stock and I have to wait a little longer, its fine with me. And it is not an excuse for me that they didnt have it in stock, because it clearly stated in the webshop, that they had it there, plus these few warehouses also had it, where I could have picked it up from. I think it is unexceptable to wait 3 weeks for a package within the same country, when one can order from, lets say, the US, and the package is there within a week. The printer is nice though, I am happy with that. Small, sleek, silent and modern. But next time I order, I would rather choose to pick it up myself.
I am amazed and shocked by Stacy's W.'s report. It certainly comes nothing near the experience I've had with Azomedia. I have bought many blank DVDs, CDs  and ink cartridges over the years, and I've always been treated very nicely indeed. The products they sell have always been of the highest quality and the services they offer are swift, reliable, fair and cheap. I can only give them the best references.
As mentioned the print was as expected and delivery time slightly faster than expected. 2 problems with this site though. A few things have gotten lost in translation on their website (at least for danish locale), and this just feels half finished and tacked together with sticky tape. My biggest problem with my transaction with these guys is the intensely annoying spam that you recieve afterwards. Every single day, at least 1 or 2 new messages comes through with "oh the greatest offer ever!!!  ...just for you!!". It gets really annoying after the first one. Attempting to cancel the subscription to this newsletter that somehow you sign up for when purchasing, is not really as easy as it should be. There is a "Cancel subscription" button, but it leads you into some horridly flawed half english half danish part of the website which asks something along the lines of: "If you wish to only recieve great offers and deals from vistaprint in the future press Afmeld (danish for cancel)". TL;DR, Great quality print, fast delivery (i might've gotten lucky on that). However, you get a little more than you pay for, as your inbox will be chuck full of spam mails from vistaprint after purchasing anything-
I er da bare fantastiske , lyn hurtig dag til dag levering , og varen tip top
Army-star.com haven't disappoint me yet, and hope they don't i like their products they have. They are all good and in good quality :)
This Company advertised previously under www.runfreesko.dk, but changed web site due to more fake deliveries and following caims. Now they try again under new name but don't deal with them. It's for sure counterfeit products delivered from a Chinese company. We checked with Nike and the Nike Store agreed when we showed the shoes to them. Stay away from dealing with this Company. Henrik
Their service could not answer an admittedly very specific question about the product - but they kindly took the time to try... Otherwise very competitive price and professional transaction.
I ordered for over 700 USD here and got 2 parcels- which were EMPTY! I also payed  over 1000 NOK ( a bit less than 200USD) to the customs to Fedex whom delivered the packages and prepayed for the customs. KEEP AWAY-GOOGLE THE COMPANY!
I have bought BitCoins two times from them, and everything very smoothly. If you are scandinavian, i think that is the easiest way to buy BitCoins on the internet. I do not like Mt.Gox since they require (too) much personal information like ID, passport and so on. In addition, i have account in Danske Bank, it means that the transfer is immediate. The website ir also easy to navigate and there is no unneccesary stuff like ads. I recommend this site to everyone strongly!
Det har været en fornøjelse at handle med dem alt var bare i orden
Det er et super firma - god hjemmeside - hurtig levering
I finally got my order, but i had to get paypal to contact them before any reaction from their side.
I have now shoppen 2 times from ktmschnellversand and i must say, the service is at the top. I have recently lost my kickstarter and ktmschnellversand have very quickly answered all my emails, and promptly dispatched the package
I always loved ZYB! But when i was visiting there site today, it said that they have been bought by vodafona360 and as result you can not create a new user on the site. Unfortunately, all good things have an end - goodbye ZYB, I doubt that vodafona will do any good with the old ZYB and definately not for free :-(
Always the best prices and never any issues when checking in at the hotel. Seems way more trust-worthy than other webpages similiar to Easytobook.com.
i had my kid photographed by her for 2 mos.ago.  i paid the amount of the photo the same day the picture was taken. and it's not cheap! i thought, i would have the picture right away, she said no. she said, it would take  4 weeks. so she took a picture of the photo using my iPhone on her computer screen. (IMAGINE THAT!) aside it's really bad quality, you can see her reflection on the screen when she took the photo on the computer screen. i asked if it's possible to have the photo and the dig.copy sooner, since i need the digital to have more copies for my family, she said, ok, she'd label "hurry". she'd just call or email me when it's ready. i went for a holiday, no email received. i thought, she'd tried to call me while i was on holiday so i emailed her  but i did not get any reply. i've been calling her since i got home from holiday asking how it is, 'got to talk with her assistants everytime since she won't take my call. her assistants promised 'would let Anette call me back. i called many times, i mean many times, she only called me back once saying, she'd take a look at it. i made a follow-up call and again 'couldnt get through her. SHE GOT PAID ON TIME, SHE'D HER MONEY AND NO RIGHT PICTURE. really great....huh
I have used them several times, always the right stuff well wrapped for shipping. I my oppinion, a good online shop with good offers !
Ordered an item on a friday, I had it tuesday ! ... and the item lived fully up to my expectations ... since then I have used them again ..... you can trust this store, they give a good service :-)
I have used them more than once, they are okay ... good to communicate if something is missing before they can send the order. The goods have been securely wrapped ! For example if you buy spokes of different lengths, they are labeled with length. Something like that makes you use them again!
Needed a missing Derailleur Hanger, found it easily on http://www.pilo.co.il webpage. At first, I had a little doubt if I could trust this webpage, could not find any rating about this homepage. But I chose to order anyway .... actually, I ordered two different types of hanger, both were very easy to locate on their website. Had no problem, package arrived after about a week ! And both fitted perfectly in to my frames ! If I need a derailleur hanger another time, I will go looking for it at pilo again ! You can trust this Homepage !
Really good products and Lintronic provides second to none support if you encounter any type of problem with their products. I would recommend Lintronic to anyone who has an interest in their products without hasitation. And to those of you who don't know their products be shure to check them out!
jeg her ovenud tilfreds med at handle med T Hansen
Good: - The service was the fastest I have experienced with online purchase of computer things. The product was shipped 1h30m after I ordered, and delivered in less then 2 days after! - Great prices! - Good range of equipment on gaming accessory. Bad: - The website was lacking some advance search/selection mechanisms other websites (like pixmania.com) have. - Range of other material was poor (like Monitors and other products, but for gaming accessory was good)
I ordered a product online (a birthday present for my boyfriend). The order went through as usual and then a day later I received an email saying I would not receive the product until July. This is VERY bad service and I am extremely unhappy with it. You should inform customers on your website if something is not in stock and if it will be delivered late. I will never order anything from Hi-Fi Klubben again.
What can I say... I ordered it Sunday night and it was home by Tuesday morning! Keep up the good work!
I got my sunglasses 5 days after I orderet them and in perfect condition.
I haven't made a reservation via hrs.com yet, but I often use their website for price reference. Competing websites often don't show prices for e.g. dogs, they are almost always shown on hrs.com. Looking forward to use your website in the future! :-)
In need for a sleepingbag I found it at a fair price at PM-outdoorshop in Germany Tuesday, late at night I ordered a sleeping bag. Wednesday, I got ordering confimation and later shipping information. Friday morning I receivede the package in Denmark. So I'm very happy with PM-outdoorshops service
I bought a digital tuner which was defective and did not live up to the advertised specifications. Although the product was at fault (typical chinese lack of quality), the service from Pixmania in returning the item was really good, and also repayment of the purchase price. I wouldn't buy large items here, but for small stuff the risk is not so great should things go bad.
I bought tickets to Faroe Islands and there were no issues with the tickets, or the booking with Atlantic Airways. I did, however, have an issue with the flight cancellation insurance and Priority service, which I specifically did not choose, but nevertheless, it appeared as a choice I had to pay for even though I didn't want it. I immediately wrote an e-mail to the travelstart.se customer service and within a very short time, was credited the flight cancellation insurance. This is obviously not ideal, but what's important is that they refunded me the extra, and generally I'm pleased with the experience. I will use them again.
It's just that. 1 - Order fullrate 2 - Receive equipment, plug it in and it works. ... does what it says on the tin! MUCH better than being messed about by TDC who don't understand that in today's world, people want solutions now... not in 6 weeks after multiple calls to a helpdesk to explain problems over and over again. TDC 0 - Fullrate - 1
This was not explained to me when buying it, so the good old Danish Returret means nothing to Fona. They would not return my cash, and offered a gift certificate instead. I'll NEVER be back here if I'm treated like a fool.
Well, i got the game called Farcry 2 before Farcry 3, but Punkbuster didnt support it so my multiplayer was borken, and the support site that was written in the game didnt exist, so i open ubisofts page, and asked for support... an other way to wirte what they said to me "Its not our problem go fuck your self" And from now off, its a good bye to Ubisoft for me..
Vi er glade for OK og der er god service .
Super wine and quick and easy collection and handling of my order at Philipson.
Always perfekt service and ther word is always kept. The informations they give is valid and there homepage is very informative.
quickly sent the order. Track number is issued on request.loved the service
I have ordered two times, where the products I did order came (1st time was a little trouble, due to DHL failed to inform that they have been out for delivery). The new website is perfect to navigate through, and the price guarantee they offer is great - they transfer the price guarantee back after the purchase has been completed. Nonetheless they are the cheapest retailer for bike equipment (especially components for the bike). When I bought a lock for my bike, I needed to have paper with stamp from the retailer (BIKE-Components) in order to get the insurance money, if my bike gets stolen. They have been writing with me, and is standby for the stamping of the documents, if it is required from med. I will definitely purchase from BIKE-Components in the future. 5 star premium service!
only missing the trip to the shop - it is always a pleasure visiting HiFi klubbens stores
Clear communication and reaction is inportant for me, and thats what I always meet. I have only received higly quality clothes.
Er super glad for mine ting jeg har bestilt hos jer :)
I ordered the glasses after seeing an add to get 20 % off, and it was almost half the price of what I would have paid at home. And the glasses were great. Love them.
The commission for buying is somewhat high (9%), but they are very open about it. However, if you do not want to go through Mt.Gox, and are in Scandinavia, this is a good alternative. I recently applied to Bitcoin Nordic to sell Bitcoins for more than €1600. A few hours later, I got an address where I should transfer the Bitcoins to. The next morning (some hours later) I received an e-mail, telling me that the Bitcoins had been sold, and the money transferred. The next day again, the money was in my bank account.  Absolutely recommendable, if you can accept the commission, and do not want to go through Mt.Gox. Edit: To specify the comment above, there is a commission on 9% (not 10%, as I originally wrote) on *buying* Bitcoins. For *selling* Bitcoins they charge 4.9%, with a maximum of €15. Thus, for selling lots of Bitcoins, the commission is indeed quite low.
I have used LensOn for 1½ year, and I have always been very satisfied with their service og products. I can recommend anybody to use this company.
Order :DE180270 First delivery at the 22/12/12,,,the flowers were allmost dead when they arrived ,,not fresh at all !! Euroflorist did offer to redeliver a new and bigger bouquet as compensation. They did not deliver as agreed at the 3/1/13,,,but instead at the 4/1/13 ,,,and it was not a bigger bouquet as promised either !!! And now the consumer service do not answer my mails anymore !!
Fantastik support , verry Quick to handle service request no time at all , and i got the right guide to install my POP3 mail
Pc én i fin stand så alt i alt en win win historie
I'm from Denmark, but Ive visited the store and ordered online. They have excellent service and called me shortly after i ordered to verify my address. I returned to shoes though, but without any problems. Thumbs up!
If you make a purchase, for some RED suitcases and branddeveloppement delivers them in BLACK. branddeveloppement is 1 week to reply on each email, and and ongoing email corrospance has now taken more than 5 weeks. branddeveloppement will have the custumer to pay for there mistake and have the customer to pay the packet that they have delivered in a wrong color, branddeveloppement only gives a 15 euro in discount if i chose to keep my suitcases in the wrong color.  but all i want is branddeveloppement to pay for the return for there mistake and i can send the suitcases back ath there expence. and then branddeveloppement can send me som new suicases in my orderer color = RED How hard can i be!!!! The proces with returning my suitcases is still ongoing........
I love YOOX, mostly their sales bit, and the fact that they have both high-end and budget clothing. The only thing I could wish for, is that they didn't UPS because they deliver our packages to our neighbor, who we don't know. The first time they sent it back because they didn't know that it was our package.
Even if you want to delete your account it is not possible. And they don't answer if you write to them. I am glad, that I never bought anything from them!!!
Var en gave til min mand - og han er meget glad for den
Ok, here's an update: Great follow-up from Nemlig.com. They called yesterday, told me how important it was to serve customers in general and me in particular.  I was truly impressed with the professionalism and the actions they took to rectify the situation. Today I got my frozen goods delivered and for that I'm glad. However, the package included a bag of "Hold Kæft Bolcher".  Seriously?! Tror I at jeg ikke taler dansk? What's worse: that they did this intentionally or that it was an oversight? Wow. What a great selection. Wow. What poor delivery. An entire box of frozen goods doesn't arrive. And it was for our dinner. If the main selling point of nemlig.com is selection AND convenience, if I have planned to have X arrive at 16.00, and the confirmation email from nemlig tells me that it is all on its way; I am one cross mother when I am now at home, with the kids and no possibility of getting out of my apartment when a significant portion of the order doesn't come. Mega irritating.  I have the distinct feeling that nemlig.com thinks that their business is purely a web shop. No thought at all has gone into the delivery part.
I had ordered a helmet camera. I received the box after 6 day only to find a seeling cap broken for the camera broken. FC-MOTO could choose to send a new straight away (I guess the cost is not very high) to replace the broken part. However, instead they choose to question my honesty and request me to return the part for them to inspect (I had documented the incident via a photo). I have the cost and hazzle of returning the part.... 29th August - update. FC-MOTO are not able to help me out. I have followed their instruction to retun the broken part via the cheapest route. As I am still waiting, I have now tried to buy the broken part - no help......again....
wow, 2 days from china to my door in denmark, a sms 3 times telling mee all the info i need.
Strange to read the bad ratings for this company. I have now been using it for a couple of years and have had nothing to complain about. A couple of times, the products have disappeared, but one mail have been enough to correct it, also if I wanted my money back. Quality is really good compared with branded products and so is the price. Would definitely recommend them to anyone.
2 x Kamik støvler; 1 par giggles + 1 par waterbug
I bought 2 items from the website, i was suprised when i got an email at around kl 22 that the items were shipped i bought the items around kl 19, i must say i was very impressed by the service i received. Thanks alot. Natasha Vanløse.
I bought a lamp in November 2013 Lamp I have never received I have now objected through Eurocard
Since Brandos shoes encouraged me to review their service I will do so. Service and information have been lacking and dissapointing; I ordered a pair of sneakers and discovered (by accident visiting my account) two weeks later that the order was cancelled by Brandos. I have no Idea why this happened as no information was given - I have heard nothing from them apart from an email encouraging me to review their services. Obviously a reason exists why the order was cancelled, but not even dropping an email about it is just not good enough! Unfortunately I have to rate a minimum of one star - if less was possible I would do so!
I have tried for several days  - at least 50 times - to buy Alhambra tickets with my Danish Visa Card - every time I get an error message: "Due to an unexpected error we are unable to deal with your request. Please try again later". My friends and family (5 people) have all tried as well using their private Visa Cards and there own computers - but they too get the same error message (and we have all checked with our banks - our Visa Cards are working OK). I have contacted Ticketmaster by mail several times, but only get a standard answer, that doesn't help. I have tried calling the phone number for abroad customers listed on the alhambradegranada.org page (Phone Abroad: (34) 93 4923750) but an answering machine with a lady saying something in very fast Spanish - I don't understand Spanish - is all I get. I really really wanted to go to Alhambra, but seems I'm not going -THANKS TICKETMASTER - NOT!
No complaints at all about the site or service but delivery from southern Sweden to Copenhagen took 3 days which seems pretty slow. I would buy again from the site without hesitation.
Order arrived on time with no problems at all. The site also had the cheapest prices after checking at least 5 other sites with the same items.
I bought a Blue-Ray player/HDD recorder. It was easy to set up and i could select danish as language. But after it failed to record scheduled tasks two times i found out that it is a model meant for the UK and Ireland. I couldnt select any other country during the channel setup. As I live in Denmark I cant setup the correct country/timezone which means the recorder cant record anything scheduled. Pretty much useless then. I think I will buy my electronics in Denmark from now on.
I received products next day, without any surprises!!! Definitely I will shop more at just4kids.dk...
I've shopped here several times, but will never do so again. I've waited several for weeks to get a refund for an item I ordered a month ago. Even though the item was "in stock" Gabberwear couldn't deliver it. Gabberwear promised to issue the refund 2 weeks ago. They still haven't done so. They were really quick to take my money - I am still waiting to get it back. I will probably have to file a claim with Paypal soon. Completely unacceptable!
I would definitely recommend this page to others. Fast delivery, cheap prices, excellent quality and many product.
They have a large selection, good prices and very fast delivery...what else can one ask for?
Hi, I had a very good service experience with Epplehuset today; I went in with my MacPro book to have the head phone slot repaired, as I couldn't shift from using the internal speakers to headphones by plugging them in. A guy at epplehuset knew a trick to reset the RAM, so I could take my Mac with me back home right a way - working like it is supposed to with sweet music in the earphones!
I am satisfied with my order from multimedia world.The only problem I have experienced was that the item wasn't in stock.On the web page was saying it will take 2-3 days. After those 3 days I recieved e-mail ,that I have to wait for 10 more days. And suddenly I recieved the package before those 10 days.So the information on the webpage was not accurate. However I am glad I got the package earlier then the last information I got(about the 10 days delay)
No problems, about 24hour delivery time when I bought through bank transfer
Alt i alt en super oplevelse at handle hos Cocopanda
De giver god info og det er super let at handle hos spartoo.
decent pricing but ill waited for a Whole week before they shipped my wares even tho they were on stock.
I love it when all you need do is click on a few buttons, enter a few numbers and in a day or 2 you get what you wanted.
Det var da en sand fornøjelse at handle her .....all in all perfekt!!
I have ordered and payed for a flag, which I am still waiting for.
Need to change winter tyres and got offer cheaper than market average
I sent my MBP 17 for diagnosis and got offer for replacing Logic board. Test was fast but i did not get where exactly problem was. I could not get details even after requesting it.
Kan blot ytre at jeg har haft en god oplevelse med positive dialog. Anbefaler at handle med Jupiter
When I wished to cancel my subscription I contacted their chat support. However, they informed me that since it were 26 days before the end of the billing term I was forced to pay for another year! In other words: they want a 13 months cancellation notice!!! They even refused to change the bill to 1 month instead of 1 year to cover their "30 days cancellation policy". In my book this is conmanship of the worst kind, especially considering that I have been a faithful customer since 2005! Be warned that One.com WILL cheat you if they get the chance!
Amazon was my favourite store, until they increased their shipping rates from 0 to high cost. Unless you are from the UK or rich, shipping cost are way to costfull compared to many other sites. The information about change in shipping conditions, was send out to their customers, the day after it was changed, nice way to threat customers.
Jeg er super tilfreds med de køb som jeg har haft lavet. Og deres dele er til en god pris.
Delivery time and condition of the goods was good but had to visit the store twice to pick up the goods as despite having been advise goods were ready for pick up they weren't there so had to go back the next day to get them.
Fantastic pre delivery information and delivery was carried out in an extremely timely manner on the day and time requested.
The web site was easy to use, once the order was placed it took only 2 days before I could pick up my goods.  Despite the fact that I was not able to select GLS delivery on the web site (the function didn't works that day), I sent a mail to the customer service address asking that the goods be sent via GLS and not Post Denmark.  This was not a problem and I could pick up my parcel at my local Kiosk the next day.  A really good shopping experience!
Alt i alt en rigtig god oplevelse at handle med Dubuy
i can recomande this store and i have had a fine treatment no problem.
nbo.dk is the webshop of whiskymessen.dk. I've been looking out for tyrconnell whiskies in Denmark for some time now and found this website after a google search. I've just bought a Tyrconnell 15 yr single cask at a good price. Delivery was fast and the bottle was well packaged. I'm sure the postman could have played football with the parcel without breaking the bottle! Wouldn't hesitate to order from them again.
Jeg er glad for at handle hos jer, god service alt tid.
I ordered a Lacie Rikiki 500GB on 10 November. I did not receive my order until 22 nov. Very slow delivery when their page states 3-4 days. After plugging in the HD I find out that it is broken. I can not back up my files. This is not Pixmania's fault, but when you go to return order  section on their site they urge you to contact the Manufacturer. Why should I have to contact Lacie? I have a contract with Pixmania who has sent me a broken product. I just want to return the HD as soon as possible. I expect Pixmania to pay for the return cost. Anyhow I have written to their support. I might follow this review up once i have their reply (which should be within 24 hours according their automated mail response)... update 29 november. Pixmania did respond and in a positive manner. they have made a small refund due to the long delivery and offered to take back the product. However i have discovered that it was in fact not the drive that was faulty but the longer USB 2.0 cable that I used. It works fine with the short USB cable it comes with and when changing to another USB 2.0 cable it runs just fine. I have changed status from ** to **** because of professional customer service and good prices. I will shop there again just not when I'm pressed for time. Thank you to Nina for responding.
I have used this site several times for buying great stuff for our carrera racetrack. Myracer.de has a large range of cars and tracks and also spareparts and the site is very nice build and gives good overview. I used to pay via moneytransfer which was ok but now they have a paypal option and I use that. But most important: delivery is fast, easy and securely packed. Thank you once again myracer.de. I'm sure my kids will love their christmaspresents.
Easy to use and good search options for distance, room rate at the location.
When claiming for compensation due to theft while abroad, the process was efficient, fast and friendly - and the outcome was very fair and hassle-free. Great experience.
Great selection of military clothing, however a large number of items where not available
prisen er god men nu venter jeg bare og modtage de ting jeg har bestilt
DTU is a place where you can study hard, be a clever engineer and have good job position
If you are willing to loose your money or someone rub you...you should choose TDC :)
Whenever I buy something from them, they just deliver it so quick, almost the day after I order :)
Run by a Dane - as serious and serviceminded as they come...
Alt levede op til mine forventninger. Og super med gratis levering!
Sorry about writing in English; it's the best way for me to express my true feelings. I bought a camera from these people some time ago. Yesterday the shutter broke, which is why I was reminded of them again. The male salesperson came across as extremely unfriendly. During the sale I tried to engage him in conversation about the camera, but his only concern was for me to stick my Dankort into his machine and get me out of his shop. My feeling was that he was one of those people who didn't like foreigners, but after reading some of the other reviews here, it seems that he just doesn't like customers in general. It is a mystery to me how he can still be in business. It's been a few years since I dealt this company, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth when I think about them. The one-star review I give them is one star too many.
If I can choose free shipping, I'll do it. I live in Denmark, so I should recieve it within 5-7 days. I received a dress 2 days after I ordered it I received the shoes 30 days after I ordered it The products were of good quality and exactly what I expected :)
I had made a purchase and did the mistake of chosing the wrong items. I sent a mail that i wanted to cancel the purchase but customer service didn't see the mail in time and the package got sent anyway. After calling customer service they kindly offered a full refund and let me keep the package.
I ordered a phone one day (delivery at the physical store), got a phonecall that it is ready and got it the next day.
Ive got what i expected, so just feel good at trading at HOWDIAUDI
I have ordered for around 500 euro in total from taiwangun and ive never had a problem. Things always get sendt the next day and whenever i have a question about a product i can ring em up and they seem to always awnser with a smile. They have the cheapest prices in europe so i will be shopping there again :)
My danish is bad but you will understand  when I tell that I'm happy because I used  service of your company!
First.. All the things i recived was in good condition for at good price. But i did not recive my gloves. They were fast with taking the payment before shipping the order...  i would like to have had the chance to order another pair of gloves or at least to get a notice that there would be no gloves in the pack... and they took payment for them... and compensated me later.
Der er ikke super service, men alt i alt er den ganske god i forhold til prisen!
Efter EB er lavet om er det den største rode side jeg har set
The service was Quick and korrect and the gear was as good as described .
jeg har har købt to sweet trøjer og de er fine
Large selction of design glasses which you won't find in any store and especially not at that price. Easy to order and fast delivery. I'll be back in 3-4 years for my next new glasses.
I ordered some high-end head phones and they quickly arrived in perfected condition.
Nettalk customer, could not be easier to use and change. Checking account or changing of service levels is excellent.
Everything went as it should, fast expidition, really good machines they have somewhere I sure will trade again. René
I bought two mugs here, and my package came 2 days after I placed the order.  They also wrapped each mug ((even though I had forgotten to ask for it ), because they realized its close to Christmas, and they were probably gifts.  They included a nice hand-written note, and their thoughtfulness made my day.  :)
I love the RAR Eames chair.!! I live in Denmark, so I chosed to book with another woman, to save some money on the shipping ... She ordered the chairs for her address, and I picked up my chair at her place, yesterday :) It is perfect!! I have just ordered 3 more chairs.! 1 big, and 2 for my children... Looking forward to get them.!! I will defently shop at lakeland furniture again :)
One of the best IDE's e have ever seen for PHP programming.. I have tried many alternatives, but i keep falling back to this one, i REALLY love this piece of software.. it is AMAZING! Can only be recommended.. 5 Stars from me!
Alt levede op til de forhåbninger jeg har til en god nethandel.
fast delivery to Denmark , very beautiful wallpaper - not the last time I buy from you! Thanks for good service!
I ordered my goods one afternnon and received them the day after, no hazzle, no problems, it just works!
After having placed an order @ Swiminn, they cashed the money from my account before the purchased item was even in stock. When the item was in stock again, they failed to send an email notification about when to expect the shipment. In my case I had to ask the online-help for order status. The delivery courier came to my address during working hours, and did not leave any information about the attempt to deliver a package. Neither did Swiminn contact me. Again I had to contact the online-help only to be told that the delivery courier handed the package to some neighbour a few days ago.. No information about why -or to who.. After having talked to everybody who could have been &quot;my neighbour&quot;, I had to write to the help-desk again, to find out that the package had been handed over the nearby post office. Finally I got it! But it took two weeks with uncertainty to get it. But I have never experienced such an amateur way of handling a simple order. Karsten, Denmark
I have bought several items from this site and would concider myself as a satisfied costumer. All though I have had one bad experience when I bought a bicycle lamp; when I received the lamp it was obvious that the (lamp-) package has been opened before and the lamp had a big stratch on the side. Unfortunately I first discovered this one month after I received the lamp :(
I just needed one ink cartrige so this will often make the item just as cheap in the local supply store. But with Ink House it's still cheaper to have it sent by mail to my house than going 3 miles to the local store. Delivery time was one day so a top rating from me.
Everything was just as I expected I'm so happy for my purchase's .
I buy a 2 WD external harddisk and the process was in the best stand ever.
alt et i orden gode til at holde hvad de lover
I have just been visiting the new max in Denmark, and the food didnt taste of anything at all, i must admit i am amazed that even with bacon on my burger, it still didnt have any taste, i have to give 1 star, but this is actually a ZERO, last time i visit.
I have ordered several runningshoes from Denmark and every time the delivery time has spot on! The products are perfect and there is nothing negative to say about purchasing shoes from this side - it is not the last time that I will order from this site..
Products arrived swiftly - i returned one product because i changed my mind. Refund process worked great and fast.
Det er en fornøjelse at handle med jer, det I lover holder I flot
How im lucky to find u Every thing was perfect Very happey to bay form them ..
I payed for 3 downloads, and i downloaded 3 different files, to find out 2 files was the same album. I have contacted Cdbaby on email several times, to get the missing album i have payed for, but never got any response. I will never use Cdbaby again.
I have now made ​​my first purchase at Scandic Gold and I'm certainly not disappointed, the staff is nice and the service is always at the top! I will definitely recommend this page to others!
No delay in receiving the package, and the products were fine quality. No complaints.
Hi Trustpilot & Co. I randomly found this webshop, and thought it was kind of funny. Then I saw that they accepted bitcoins as a payment method, and I therefore decided to buy some different cool gadges who could 'safe' me in the future :-) They turned up 2 days later, and I got a free keyfinder + condom because I was the 100th costumer. Nice man!
From day one when I first bought clothes from Army Star, I was very satisfied with the quality of the purchace and the extremely short delivery time.. I would at any time recommed this Company to any of my friends and Family. Yours Hans Daugaard
Army Star is fast to deliver your product and I haven't experienced anything bad about them. They are also easy to order at and have most payment methods
alt ok det er ikke sidste gang jeg handler med jer
I bought a flashlight, that arrived broken. I just dident work at all. I contacted costumer service, that asked for proof that the flashlight was broken. I then spend some time making a video, that shows the defect flashlight and send it to costumer service - they were just stalling, and asked for more videos  - they just keep asking for more and more. I guess they just dident entend to do anything about the problem. The flashlight was cheap, but  if it dont work, its to expensive.. I recommend to find another supplier
The Pixmania nightmare: May 21. I bought a Chromebook from Pixmania-France; it was an obvious thing to do as I spend several month in France every year and as the Chromebook is not available in Denmark where I come from. I even paid 15 euro extra for fast delivery (within 24 hours they promised)  So I followed my parcel closely on the GLS website from Paris over Roquemaure to Les Arcs not far from where I live in France and on may 23. at 15:11 hours GLS declared the parcel "LIVRE" "Delivered" Only it was not delivered to me; I never saw it! Apparently a sloppy driver handed over the parcel to an unknown person in an unknown place who signed for receiving the parcel with my first name probably copied from the parcel. I immediately complained about this to Pixmania on the morning of may 24. and in the afternoon the same day they mailed me a document that I had to fill out and return by mail together with identification (I used a photocopy of my passport) I did this as fast as I possibly could on may 25. with the necessary documents attached as PDF files (Even though Pixmania-France stubbornly refused to write in any other language than French witch made communication difficult and forced me to seek help from my French friends as my French is not yet good enough to communicate on this level) On May 27. I recieved a cryptic mail from Pixmania that not even my French friends could clearly understand but a good guess was that something was missing in the documents so I immediately mailed the documents for the second time and at the same time asking what the problem was. Next morning I had my friends to go over the whole thing trying to figure out what was wrong. In the end we mailed the documents a third time and with a comment in French. May 28. I received a mail from Pixmania that they had still not received the documents they said that the sent document was empty!!!! So I mailed the documents again this time from both my Gmail and my Windows Mail. Next step  will be to send the documents by fax if I can find a fax machine. I have mailed the PDF files to friends and family and everybody can open them! May 29. 2013 I found a fax machine and faxed the documents to Pixmania. Later the same day I received a mail from Pixmania that they now had the documents  but the identification, my passport (or so I think; it is not quite clear), was unreadable and that I must fax it again and this time (I think) photocopies of the cover of the passport. In the mean time they have apparently done nothing to clear up the matter and made  no attempt at retrieval or replacement. May 30. 2013 My French speaking friend phoned Pixmania and learned that there should be no problem with opening PDF files; they do it all the time in costumer service, but it would be a good idea if we mailed the documents also as JPG files and to two different mail addresses and including a photocopy of the cover of my passport. So I mailed it  for the ninth time and for safety we also faxed the documents for a second time. On May 30. 2013 late afternoon I received a mail in English recommending that I contacted Danish Pixmania. I will do so but how that should help is beyond me as the Chromebook was bought and disappeared in France. It sounds as if they think I have ordered the Chromebook from Denmark. I am afraid that Pixmania customer service is total chaos. Later in the afternoon  on may 30. I received a mail from "mr. James Felix"  himself chief of customer service where he declared that now steps were being taken with GLS to clear up the matter. In the morning of may the 31. mr. "James Felix"  mailed me again and told me that the investigation with GLS was started and it would take 10 days. I also tried to contact Pixmania Denmark as I was advised to do but my mail was refused by the Pixmania Postmaster. And I have of course mailed to "Nina" what she asked for here on Trustpilot. Honestly I believe that a sound business would get around to deliver the items that I have bought to my address here in France as soon as possible. I feel real lucky that I only bought a Chromebook at 300euros and not one of the cameras that Pixmania sell at 3000euros.
Easy homepage - quick order - nothing to complain about
I have been looking for the digitalized film music from Zorba the Greek and finally found it on imusic. Swift and efficient order handeling, to the point and no-nonsense service !
Det er en fagforening son er god til at hjælpe
This shop is very good, it has a lot of products, and, the most important, it respects the client with all his problems. I made 2 orders to them, and both arrived fast and in perfect condition. I have even ordered the wrong product, so I had to send it back. This process worked flawlessly. I got the money back immediately. This shop rocks.
I ordered a car in Nice this summer and booked the car over the internet. When we came back with the car the price got about 200 Euro more expensive than when it was booked. I wrote to Europcar about that - but noone wants to listen. It is the last time I use Europecar and I tell everyone to stay away from them. You can nok believe them :-(
feel more effort should be put into delivery, take a day off and wait for an appliance to arrive???, must be a joke
Have been using avg for some years, with only minor problems. Then yesterday a message popped up on my desktop - avg offered to install their pc tune up program for free. I accepted and it killed my pc. I am back again today, having had the pc to a repairshop. Don't go there :-)
I have unfortunately been using Air France and their bonus program for the last five years, to my regret. First, I have never had a flight with Air France that was not either delayed greatly or early(!). Second, in spite of numerous flights across half the world, I can use their bonus program for absolutely nothing. In comparison, I have started taking my longer flights with Sas in the last year, and already I am a gold member, enjoying lots of benefits. Five years of earning points with Air France (flying to Colombia, Cuba and southern europe) has given me not a single benefit. I have not even been upgraded in their program! (ha ha, I know who is the fool for enduring this for five years...) I don't want to use hours and hours describing my bad experiences with Air France, so here are a few: Returning from Bogota to Paris with AF. We are in the plane when getting told to get off because they have a problem. We get a busride to a hotel, after waiting 5 hours in the airport, with no information. In the hotel we are told (in no polite terms) that the Air France customers must wait with checking in, if any regular customers want to check in first. We get a meal ticket, but again are told that Air France customers can not sit by the windows in the restaurant, as these seats are reserved for the regular customers. (of course we sat down by a window and told the waiters that they could just call the police) 37 hours later we depart for Paris. 7 months after this, again Bogota-Paris. In Colombia, I get an email that Air France personnel will go on a strike, and that I have to change my flight. No problem, I try calling Air France. And try and try. I call for 21 hours (!) to no avail before getting through. By then they say that I must either depart two days prior to my scheduled flight, or wait an uncertain amount of time for a flight at a later date. I choose to depart earlier, but by then it is almost too late, so within one hour of talking to Air France "customer service" I have to leave for the airport. Two days earlier than scheduled. No need to say that this was a stressing experience. On top of this, I have never been offered any compensation for the accountless delays or troubles. My travel companion took the time to write a complaint (got no answer) then another complaint (no answer), then numerous calls to AF, where after he finally got some bonuspoints as compensation. Is it just me or is that unequal treatment? And by the way, he has never had anything to use his bonus points for either. I wish I had more time for this, as there are so many more similar experiences to describe, but I am altogether done with Air France. 1 star here on Trustpilot is way too much for Air France, but unfortunately I have no lesser choice. Never again Air France. Update 27. september 2013: I have 28000 AF points that I lose in one month if I don't use them. Wanted to use them on a hotel (since I am never flying AF again), and AF and Hilton have a collaboration. But the link from AF to use points at Hilton doesn't work. I write to AF to tell them that the link hasn't been working for two weeks, and ask what to do. Their answer shows exactly the mindset that makes AF "service": "Thank you very much for your message dated 26 September 2013. You informed us of the difficulties that you encountered on our website. Connection problems may occur occasionally, we apologize for the inconvenience caused. We invite you to try later. We thank you for your continued loyalty to the Flying Blue programme. Your Flying Blue team" WE INVITE YOU TO TRY LATER!! Thank you so much for the help AF. You're awesome!

Det er en super fed forretning, med en super god service og god kundeservice.
I ordered a full computer in parts  (around 1100 euro's) i however had to wait for some of the parts to get home i received my case which unfortunately was broken due to rough delivery or wrongfully assembly at the factory they how ever responded fast and accurately, and even after some unfortunate events with the danish postal service they sent me the new case and i'll be sending the broken one Monday due to overtime at work, they have just recently sent the last of my order and even though i must have sent 12 letters they we're responded to within 24 hours and answered. very help full staff always ready to help and ready to answer every question will definitely buy here again they go that extra mile for the customer. GREAT WORK MINDFACTORY  :-D
The box was broken when I recieved it but the item was in good condition.
De har en god service varen kommer til den de har lovet.
One of the salesman there is very unprofessional and just wanted to sell the car. He did not even update the new car registration plate, so when I had an accident with the car the insurance company was unable to do anything because the new car plate was not updated. Moreover the car has defaults and I had to drive 30 km up and down atleast 4 times to get it checked. Finally I got a date next month and a months waiting for the garage. The insurance company suggested by them is also very unproffessional. I regret not selecting my own Insurance company who can help a customer professionaly.
Det er super godt at handle at handle med billigsport24.dk. Det gør jeg gerne en anden dag jeg mangler et produkt.
We received our order with in 2 days. My son is very satisfied and the clothes has a fine quality.
den service man finder her er toppen prikken over i
They have charged me 414,05 DKK but I have never seen the product nor gotten any mails from them. I have disputed the transaction. Stay as far away as possible they are scamming you. I have contacted my bank.
I ordered a pair of wayfarer sunglasses from Rayban on Sunglassesshop.com through an offer on downtown.dk. The webpage was easy to use, and have many different options to try and find the perfect pair of sunglasses and there are many to choose from. Furthermore, the delivery was much faster than expected, and I received the sunglasses safe and sound within a week from ordering! Great service!
We were charged Nkr. 71,- for fuel. On our way from Stavanger to Sola airport we filled the tank. We could not possibly use anymore than 1 litre on that distance. They charged us for 71/15=4,7 litres !? So I wrote to them and one week later I got my Nkr. 71,- back. With no excuse or explanation. I find this wierd and can't help thinking that they might charge everybody for this extra gas !?
Det har været en god oplevelse at handle med jer =)
I bought a lamp that does not work after 2 ½ month - I have contacted the seller many times, but I have heard nothing - they will not return. Super (today) I received a request from the company - I have to return the lamp so they can send a new one! - that is good service !
Telmore is a company with excellent customer support. Service quality is great as well, but customer support is outstanding.
brug dem - de er til at stole på !
I have bought contact lenses from this site for more than 5 years and have never had any trouble. Keep up the good work
Fast delivery, wonderful coffee and superb service. Products are top quality and delivery is swift. Service is simply outstanding - this is how online shopping is supposed to be.
Det er bare super at handler med MyTrendyPhone.dk mange plus her fra ++++++++
fin service - og så med dag til dag levering
Getmore fulfilled their promises, by having the item on stock, shipping it promtly so that I got it delivered just 1 day after ordering. Price was as quoted and no additional fees. Throughout the process I was well informed via e-mail, about the actual status of my order.
Short version - highly unprofessional, even ignorant customer service. Over a month since the first contact no information about product availability was given, and NO contact has been made by the seller despite several attempts made by the customer. Not a reliable seller / trade partner. Long version - I was interested in purchasing 2 KTM bicycles, a rather exotic brand on the Danish market, yet the shop's webpage offer looked good. Went there in person -nothing in stock (not yet alarming, though a bit disappointing... but this is just the beginning). I made an appointment that I'll e-mail a preliminary order list, so that they can give me a price and time frame. E-mail sent -no response for over a week. I called them -the man I've made the arrangement with didn't remember the case and said that they had lost all their computer data. I sent another e-mail (this time a quick response from the manager - "Mr. X will look at it and respond asap."). Two weeks without response. I called them again -another person promises to pass the case to the manager as Mr. X is unavailable. Another two weeks without response. Not sure if they even deserve this one star rating, looks like they're not interested in selling bikes!
good service with nice people on the phone making u feel comfortable
Easy buying process, delivery was not super fast and communication about the delivery could of been better but all in all very happy.
Det er godt at have en god bank i ryggen
I have an EKORNES Stressless chair where the seat is broken. It is the springs in the seat that is broken. ERKONES furniture is very expensive and can be separated into parts. But EKORNES cannot or will not supply spare parts for its furniture. When you go to EKORNES with your problem, EKORNES only encouraged you to buy a new Stressless chair. EKORNES are totally unwilling to help and cannot or will not provide you with solutions, how to get your chair repaired. ERKONES cost much, much more than similar furniture from IKEA, but as you cannot get spare parts for your ERKONES, so this EKORNES furniture becomes very expensive discount furniture, where customers are led to believe, by EKORNES false marketing, that they have purchased classic style furniture, which will last for years and years to come. My call to all that wants to buy EKORNES furniture must be – not to invest in EKORNES furniture. EKORNES equals to no service and absolutely no help – as EKORNES charge good customers an awful lot of money.

As usual perfect and informative home page, smooth order process and delivery as promised
It’s not my first time on DanDomain and it won’t be my last time. It’s fast and easy to order new domains on DanDomain. A few minutes after my order was sent my new domains were created. Good job DanDomain. (First time took a bit longer, but it was way before DanID)
Altid glad for at handle med dem. De holder hvad de lover
jeg har 3 nu de er lidt dyre men i top 5 med alt
Great service great products good prices & fast delivery could not wish for more.
ordered 2 sets of lights. Backlights were broken when i got them.  Fault i the print. that was the dectane testcenter wrote to me. they wont pay me back for sending them the package. about 40 euros! Contacted them many time via mail. about 10 times. And phoned once. First they told me that they work under german law and didnt have to pay back expensives i had with sending the package back. but if you read the faq on on their webside says something else... After phonecall an very poor english from the "englishspeaking" worker. they said they will contact me. They never did!!!! Now i start a case at the European consumer center because they are not following europeing laws. And it is illegal! Dont buy anything from this company!!!!!!! they are breaking European LAWS!!!!!!! So many proplems with them after they send defect item to me!!!!
I am very glad for Norwegian. They have really cheap tickets (maybe not to compare with ryanair, but they cover more destinations I am used to fly to without the need to make a change) which is important to me as a student and I am very satisfied with their service. When I had a double-booking due to the technical problems with a credit card, they were very welcoming and arranged the refund. When I went to submit the luggage without a printed ticket (as I am used to fly across the EU just with a booking reference), they helped me out too, so I did not have to stand in the line again. I also really enjoy their large planes with plenty of space I feel safe in and WiFi on board which just saves my day. The meals on board seem to be more expensive compared to the offer of an average airline company, but one has to remember that these guys are from Scandinavia :)
Nice service, quick delivery, really nice qualitative goods many of which i could not see anywhere else in physical shops.
Softwarenochbilliger / Zavita, these guys have several names. I ordered and payed in FEB 2011, for 2 x WIN_7_64bit, did only get 1 WIN_7, the 2. WIN_7, I did receive several month after, and it was a WIN_7_32bit. I ordered and payed in JULY 2011, for 1 x WIN Office 2010, have still NOT received it. I ordered and payed in JULY 2011, for 1 x Adobe Standard X, have 1 x Adobe standard 8.0 received... I have contacted them several times about the above matter, but they seem not to care ! This it the worse company and service I have ever tryed, this is very bad....
The company has a very slow customer service. There are days between replies to emails. You must have a good patience if you want to buy something in this webshop. I have received the goods. I bought a shirt and 2 armbands.
It's easy to find the stuff you are looking for, and the delivery was fast.
The service is very nice i'm happy about it, but the WEBPAGE (WEBSITE) Its only in danish and i found it bit difficult to use!
I have been using ProAspecto making 6 home-pages for me the last 10 years. The company is very flexible, speak many languages and deliver a good quality at a reasonable price. Any problem are taken care of very fast..
excellent site and service! fast - safe - secure :)

takes serveral weeks for deletion. How am i happy that mailinator can take all your crap mails while i wait in enternalty to be deleted from your system.
I er bare super duper til at overholde ale deadlines I bliver i flæng anbefalet til alle,,,
Can definitely recommend BeautyBay. Good information level and fast shipping from their storeroom. However, the delivery time could be faster. It took 13 days (9 working days) for the package to be delivered at my address - at the BeautyBay website the delivery time was estimated for 5-7 working days.
Alt for lang ventetid i telefonen. Det tog mere end 30 min for at komme til at tale med en medarbejder. Ellers super god oplevelse.
Mail fra Autoescape... "Thank you for booking with Autoescape! Unfortunately the car you have booked could not be confirmed by our supplier in Barcelona. We have tried to find another car in the same category and pricerange but have not found one. Your bookingrequest will be removed from our system. Feel welcome to visit our homepage any time to see if you can find another car that might be suitable. " Ringe service!
Alt lever op til mine forventninger Tak for en god handel
I recieved the glasses quickly and also got a tracking number for the package so all in all I have been pleased with the company. As other people have been complaining, you don't get an invoice. I asked for one a week ago and still haven't received it which I find annoying. They also managed to mix up me invoice address and the delivery address in the confirmation mail I got after ordering the glasses. I recieved the glasses and the price was good so all in all an average experience which could have been premium if the company get hold of their processes. I did not return the glasses so don't know how that would have went....
I am not customer because is not the possible to look at the prices or anything  else on iphone. I need to login or pit my postnr to go further, and when i put postnr it say it cant find it. Is 2013 make ur shit up to date or get out of way .  KU KU KU
I have been using Linode for a couple of years - it's one of my best product experiences ever. A few times I have opened a ticket with the Helpdesk - minutes later they get back to you with a qualified answer. The Linode servers do what they promise - nothing less.

A long time ago Steve Jobs’ vision for Apple was to create a premier product and charge a premium price. Now it seems that Apple have changed that vision to create a low quality product and still charge a premium price.
alt var som forventet , så ug til dem for god service .
Today internet connection is not working for the 3rd day in a row. Any updates? I called the support, waited for 15 min, just to hear that you guys are working on it. On your drift page I can see that the case is closed... But my connection still does not work. (postcode 2200) Updates: Driftstatus updated just after posting the previous review, even if the support has been hard to reach, they were precise and helpfull. My connection is back to normal.
det er bare et super sted at handle super hurtig service

Det var hurtig levering af en DVD film da jeg bestilte " Bodyguard " - super !
Well they delivered it as they told they would and they first transact the money when you get the goods.
Firmaet har alt hvad man har behov for som fotograf og de har en god service
I was a bit nervous ordering a pair of sunglasses via Sunglassesshop.com. You've got to get it right the first time to avoid sending sunglasses back and forth. The webpage is really good and you can take a close look at various different angles, which makes the choice easier. I'm extremely pleased with my Arnette sunglasses - good price, great quality.
I ordered from stock at around 13:00. By 14:00 had got a confirmation email on the order, and 15 minutes later another one saying my order had been packed. Next day around 16:00 got my package from Post Danmark. They work every time, and if they say the product is on stock, it IS on stock, which does not happen for every online shop.
I have used this site for more than 5 years. It has many advantages such as free membership where you can upload 30 photos per month and there is no limit in total as many other photo websites have. You can check photos from members around the world. You can comment on other members' photos even if you are not a member. You can subscribe to a member's photos both if you are a member or not. There are made some statistics on your photos you have which is nice to follow. If you choose a paid membership you can upload as many photos you want each month for a year and you can return to a free membership after that or continue with the paid membership. If you experience spam comments on your photos you can delete them. The site catch many of the spam comments but not all. However if you experience problems and mail to the staff they do not always reply your mails that is the only really bad thing!
I bought a pair of boots for my wife, but they make her feet hurt. She ask them to change it but they didn't take responsibility and passed her from this shop to the other shop and then they said there is nothing we can do. I heard that ecco makes low quality shoes but I just did not believe it. Never gonna buy anything from them anymore
Had bought a set Ford Mondeo Mk 3 projectorlights from dectane via amazon.de. Dectane stats that they have not sold these lights through amazon.de. But it is only Dectane which distributes these lights in europe. Therefore they have the supportresponsebility. These lights has lightbeam levelers which dont come with any usable instruction. I mailed dectane for some help regarding adjusting the beamheight on these lights. I received a somewhat rude respons, asking me to produce a invoice otherwise they wouldnt help me. Now they have stopped responding to my emails all together. I think this has been a seriously bad experience which makes regret my purchase. I will sertainly not be recommending them to anyone.
I received a text message saying that the post had tried to deliver a package to me but I wasn´t home when they tried. I found that very strange because I was home an nobody had rung the doorbell!!! This has happened so often. Then I have to go to the post office which is in Føtex in Glostrup. I have tried three times to go there and pick up my packages, every time there are about 40 people in front of me, and maybe one woman working at the counter. I saw a woman buying stamps, and it took more than 15 minutes for the woman working to find the stamps. I have worked at the postoffice and it should not take 15 minutes to sell stamps!! I have completely had enough of this incredibly bad service, and the excuse that it´s almost christmas is not good enough, they should hire more staff and have longer opening hours. An really, Post Danmark get´s an absolute fail from me
jeg har den bank så jeg synes den er god
out dated on some sites, but you will get your goods and an apoligy should the delivery date be exeded
Untrustworthy and unsatisfactory service: that is how I would refer to the delivery service at Elgiganten: I ordered my goods online due to the easiness in transport and delivery to my house, which is of great importance for me given that I am handicap at the moment. In the delivery options, I even payed extra for a special expedition. To my surprise, the goods did not arrived at my door on the times suggested. When looking at the tracking numbers, the system said that there try to deliver but noone was here, which is a clear mistake given the fact that I cannot move out of my place. They said also they tried to notify me, but I never received neither a telephone call nor a written notification. After this I called the call center, and they simply said that it was very strange, and that I should just walk to the post office to pick my goods. Walk? I cannot walk (that's why I pay an express delivery!). Finally I had to pay a taxi and get a friend to carry the stuff from a post office, increasing the inconveniance and expenses on a delivery that supposed to be fast and smooth. If this is the way you treat your deliveries, I would rather buy somewhere else
allways halpfull and easy to get your money back if any problems come up... i have used paypal for private use and buissnes use and they both are good. i have only have one time with a bad history... but all historys end one day ;)
I handed my iMac in, because the screen was yellowish. They took care of it, and I got it back, like, two weeks after. The only problem is, they did not fix the problem and they didn't fix it the second time i brought it in either.
The glasses was delivered very fast (2 days to Denmark) and they were just as I expected them to be!

First time purchasing from them and everything was fine, items delivered in time. No problems at all.
I ordered 2 items, both available for delivery, but I only received one. There was no indication or communication from Coolshop about the non-delivered item, so after four days, I had to cancel the second item. This is the second time that i order something from them,  that is not delivered. I find very annoying, that  a company presents items in stock, and finally not be able to deliver. I will never order anything from them again, sorry.
Midtdata website is easy to use and accurate, the response time was extremely short  and the price of the item i purchased very good compared to other providers. The only tiny thing it could be a little better, is to calculate the freight costs (total sum) earlier in the process. All in all excellent service.
I am completely satisfied with the service level provided by AV-CABLES. Fast, Accurate no surprises. The web site has excellent structure and it is very easy to use and find the products you need. Congratulations, keep on the excellent work!!!
had Telia before and they charged too much and cheated on the bill! Callme is definitely on another level even though they are the sister companies! good prices as well, only problem is that they dont have a shop where you can go and see the products (phones) they have! and for that they come down from 4 to 3 star. Gives them a very impersonal touch to their customer service!
I would say fast service but service is more than just the initial sale. Service is about what happens if you have a problem and what happens after that. Quite simply, their RMA department sucks. My son ordered a motherboard (Asus) for his very first solo build.  It turns out the was a defect with the board and it was sent in for RMA. That was almost 30 days ago. When he asked about the board he was told it was in England with ASUS and it when he asked about the 30 day thing he was told "we can take as long as we want to either exchange or refund the price of your board" Great service? Epic fail Proshop. I will find another vendor for all my future business, and recommend not to do business with this company unless you are buying items that don't need a warranty.
One day delivery, more than fair prices and had everything I needed. What more can I say? I am a repeat customer and intend to do business with this company again. I would 100% recommend this company to friends and family alike... Good Job Danskdatasalg, keep up the good work!
As allways a swift perfect transaction from order to receiving your goods! I can only recommend other persons to buy your footwear at ECCO Shop EU! Best regards Liliana Nielsen
I needed to exchange my American drivers license for a Danish one, and was referred to Søernes Trafikskole by a coworker. I was very impressed from start to finish. Johnnie and the other teachers were very friendly, informative, and professional.  I went to a no-obligation introducation meeting, where Johnnie explained in detail what to expect and what they offer. I chose to have lessons in Danish, but they also offer lessons in English. I was a little nervous about the online learning, as I am used to having a person teach the material, but the lessons are extremely  informative and well taught. I had previously tried to use some other online websites, which only confused me more. Here, not only do they teach the driving rules/laws, but they also explain how to take the test , which was a huge help for me. During each lesson there was a practice test, which I really liked. At the end of the lesson, there was time to go over the practice test with a driving teacher, where I could also ask any questions that I had. I also ended up being really happy for the online learning, as it offered more flexibilty for me time-wise. I never had a problem booking a computer, and I really liked having access to the lessons and practice tests from home as well. Michael was my driving teacher, and he was very laid-back, friendly, and informative, and he gave tons of good tips. I was very nervous the whole time (it is a bad habit I have when going up to any test), and he was very good to try to calm my nerves. I passed both the theory and the practical test the first time, and would highly recommend Søernes Trafikskole to anyone thinking about getting their drivers license.
Den cover var til min søn. Han siger , den er god og holbar.

I have used them for a few years now and they have good service and ok prices but they dont have that much to buy.-
I was very happy that I could get exactly this model of Ray-Ban from Smartglasses since it's not to be found anywhere else on the internet in Europe or in stores in Denmark (too expensive to buy from USA because of crazy European import taxes). I had no problems dealing with Smartglasses and I am satisfied with the sunglasses I got.
Google provides to best search engine online. It is perfect to use and fast!
Det er et god sted at handle med rigtig god vejledning
I made an order more than a month ago and the parcel still has not arrived. Yet, this company refuses to pay me back the money (I am wondering if it is even legal to withdraw the money before the customer has received the order?). I have tried to reason with them but they simply keep sending me the same standard messages about how I have to wait for several more weeks before they will take a look at this case. I have now paid for an item I have never received and I am not sure if I will get my money back.
Great service. Easy to order fast to deliver and great communication. I will be using them again!
I bought a Heider CF1 LED High power flashlight, and paid 40 € inkl freight cost. I received the lamp, and 2 weeks later I have received and extra invoice from UPS, in the amount of 26 € (import Tax from a Non EU country) because the flashlight is being shipped from the METEM company based in Istanbul / Turkey. If I knew that the real Total price for the Flashlight was 66 €, I would never have bought it. METEM have adds on Facebook that guides the consumer to supertorch.com and claims free shipping all over the world (incl. VAT) and never mentions that the flashlight is being shipped from Tukey. I feel cheated !!

Really amazing kidswear - their cotten tee's are thick and soft (and stay that way after washing). I simply love their kidswear - the design stands out (positively) compared to the brands we see in Scandinavia. I have two girls, and I love that non-pink clothing are avaliabe on boden.co.uk (Yay for yellow and other colors)

Thank You - great service. Don't think I have ever had so speedy delivery. We made the order Sunday and revived Tuesday in France without any ekstra charge... It was actually with FREE Delivery. The product was packed well, size and description was as explained on the  and we are very happy with the buy We will recommend this shop any time
god service som før jeg har handlet hos jer ... god jul til alle
In my experience DHL Denmarks delivery service is very problematic to say it mildly. To the point where I do not order online anymore if the online shop uses DHL as their parcel service! I had DHL deliver parcels on multiple occasions and every single time I have been disappointed with their service. To give you one of the many exaples: I have been waiting for a scheduled delivery for two days which after the first attempt failed (although I was at my address waiting for the parcel). The second re-scheduled attempt has also failed, again although I have been waiting at the address! I have waited for 2 days at home not leaving the house from 8-17 (!!!). (as DHL's delivery service is soooooo increadibly INFLEXIBLE when it comes to scheduling a specific time) Rescheduling the delivery was very easy through an online form,  but I did not receive my parcel on both of the rescheduled dates. To ensure delivery I instructed the driver (though DHL's customer service) to call my mobile on arrival. The driver did NOT call and I was later told by DHL's service center that the drivers have to use their private phones (!!!) to contact customers, which is of course unlikely for them to do! Apart from the driver not calling, the driver did not at anytime over the two delivery attempts ring the door bell. The door bell was functioning since I received other deliveries from the Post over the same period as DHL was meant to deliver.  I used the tracking system and could see that the package was én route, until it suddenly stated "failed delivery attempt". How is this possible, when I was at the address all day and not once the doorbell rang??? Has DHL's driver even been in front of my door? I seriously doubt it! After a long and detailed complaint to the customer service, in hope for DHL to improve on their service, I received a very unsatisfying short reply: "Thank you for your inquiry. I'm sorry your shipment was delayed." My recommendation:  Try to avoid DHL Denmark when you can - at least for now.
It is easy to buy from Parttwo.dk. Shipping is fast and convenient. However, I just want to make you aware that their 100% free return policy is not entirely 100% in my opinion. With your delivery you get a pre-paid return stamp, so you do not need to pay anything at the post office. However - after returning an entire order, I did not get the whole refund - my refund was minus DKK 59, which are their shipping cost. After contacting the customer service about this I got the following answer: " Regarding your request; We have free return policy; it means we send you, a pre-paid label to return the item, in case you want to return the item. However; it is compulsory to pay shipping charges in all the orders. We do apologise for the inconvenience" So, all in all it is quite all right to deal with them, just be aware that you will always have to pay DKK 59 even if you return your items.
Everything went easy with the ordering on the website. All the ordered goods were delivered fast. However I got my delivery two days later, not the next day, as advertised (I did not bother me, and it was probably PostDanmarks fault, but I just want to let you potential customers kn)..)
We needed some packs to our luggage and found it very easy. We got it only 2 days after.
Competent and quick customer service at Pronamic. I received the product within a few days. I can definitely recommend Pronamic if you're looking for rain gauges and precipitation gauges for professional use.
Good prices and customer service! But the deliverance with TNT is not fantastic since you have to sit at home from 8 to 4 on a weekday to receive your order.
Det er bare super at handle hos Lekmer. Alting er helt i top
Previously I shopped a lot at amazon, but now it will be way to expensive to get the items delivered, bad change.
Meget fin service God tilbagemelding om ordre God internet side
I had ordered a car-radio on Pixmania. Within 4 weeks the screen broke and then the hassle started. First of all I wanted the money returned because of previous bad experiences with the company. This was not possible due to a reason they couldn't give me. After returning the product it was supposedly sent for repair. And i didn't hear back from them. After 2 months i inquired on the RMA and they informed me that it somehow got lost. Instead of sending me a new product and an apology for the delay, they wanted to find the original product. 2 months later I again called them. Now they agreed to send me a new product. I informed about my new address. Of course they send the radio to the wrong address and again i had to wait. This was 2 months ago and I still haven't received my radio. Now the customer service ignores my requests. This is the very last time i use this company! Their product might be cheap, but it's simply not worth it.
(Skriver lige paa englesk) Had a screen repair on an ipad 2, which went well. However there was an odd problem with the 3g module after the repair. Many shops would have said 'too bad', especially in the wild west world of iphone/ipad repair shops. however these guys stood by their work and gave very fair support. Kudos. I hope to never need them again, but I would go back to these guys for sure.
Skriver lige paa englsesk: Bought my bike from them a few years back. It was a positive buying experience and even though I came in right before closing, they got my bike prepped on the spot , staying after closing time. Then a few months back, the frame on my bike cracked. They handled the whole thing super nicely, and were even able to locate my reciept since I couldn't find it. Great service, great shop.
De er god og har været glad for handle hos dem.
I shop at Zooplus.de often, and have only good experiences. Shipping to Denmark is only about 50 Dkr, so it is much cheaper to buy animal supplies here that the danish zooplus and many other danish petshops. A very nice shop with a large selection.
The vanilla pods were delivered fast, they,were high quality and they were cheap
Det er mega nemt at handle hos smart og deres levering er super hurtig.
I have few accounts with them in two different countries, as well as one loan. Internet services are very fine. Personal contact usually without any big issues. I just had two strange situations with them: *twice they declined to give me Dankort *they did not want to give me a loan for a car (they claimed that it is because I do not have permanent resident permit) Both cases where eventually accomplished. Anyway I do not plan to switch somewhere else, as I am quite happy with services and support.
It is unbelievable how can it be that I have been a client of two different companies over last 5 years of stay in Denmark, but I was never allowed to be a client in '3'. They just say that it's 'loan policy'. Right. Like I am much different from a Dane. Like I really don't stay here long, I am not educated and do not have a job. Nice of that company. Really.
I write just about the Internet connection on cable TV channel. Usually speeds are as announced. Ping and stability are also very fine. Occasionally there are short (sometimes frequent) outages. Support once was very helpful by upgrading router's software. But I still believe that I should be just informed about it earlier and it should be done automatically in short time after upgrade was available. Second time I complained about filtering some incoming ports (Microsoft File Sharing), but even if I am software engineer and I am 100% sure that configuration is fine and worked with Fullrate, I was told that they do not filter those ports. I believe that they don't want to open those ports, or people I talked with don't know what exactly is going on. Update: Finally confirmed that ports 25 (with exception of CanalDigital's server), 137–139 (udp/tcp), 445 (udp/tcp) and 1025 (udp/tcp) are closed in both directions. Quite mixed feelings.
I am client of that company for a long time already. Service is very reliable, stable and almost no issues at all. SMS system informing about failures and very quick reactions are incredible. Remember that only way to pay is credit card! Small issues: *IP telephony is so expensive, that is better not to use it at all *router I got (ZyXEL P-2602HW-D1A) or service itself does not like too many connections (like tens or hundreds; it slows down responses few times) *you cannot use your own SIP account on router provided, as well as you cannot use SIP account provided on any other device than router *I need little bit higher speeds, and Fullrate is not able to provide me such service where I live
Bought a car there. Quite happy on the beggining. Then I had two cases. After winter realized that used wheels wheren't in too good condition. Additionally it was said "one season" tires, but they where 3 years old. After warranty period (but within 6 months) air conditioning found not to cool down air. Company claims that it's repaired (not checked by me yet), but after that money where claimed to compensate half of expenses, even if there was no proof that air conditioning broke during 5-months usage. Worth mentioning that money where claimed AFTER reparation and without good PROOF. Then (8 months after deal) rust was found on the back hatch, which clearly looks like effect of production defect. It means that it was most probably there the day car was bought. Of course Kurt did not want to take care of it.
jeg ville bare sige at jeg syndes at de har en god service og har andbefalet dem til dem jeg kænder
My husband was cheated by this travel agency, his experience is described on bellow post. I am very much dissatisfied with their lack of professional behavior by ignoring our complaints. If you are looking for serious guys, trustworthy ones, they are not a good choice, better saving your breath and your money by buying with better agencies. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!
I have no complaints.  I did not know that my product was coming from Sweden so with the påske holidays the delivery time took a little longer than I anticipated. I liked getting an sms telling me that the products were on their way. The products I ordered were just as they should be.  No problems. Would order from Elgiganten again. Thanks
Sorry this is in english but . . . I have no complaints really.  I wish I had done my homework but If I had known you were just around the corner from me I would have stopped by. Are you strictly on-line purchase. I do wonder why when I order and item from Amazon it comes faster than an order that I have placed from a danish distributor without a big cost difference?  Any thought?
These guys really know how to treat customers, i have never had ANY bad experience, and cheap prices too.
I've been searching high and low for a Sack'n Seat travel chair for kids. I found it at Bambinoworld and ordered Sack'n Seat. I held my fingers crossed for a quick delivery in time for our holiday. Only 2 days later the parcel arrived in Denmark at my doorstep by GLS all the way from Austria. Perfect - thank you!!
I have bought two pairs of oakleys. Each time shipping (to DK) has been quick with UPS, price low, selection of models ok (not the full catalogue at all) but custom options for the most popular models. I would happily recommend to anyone.
Not so low cost airline with business aspirations dissapointed again. I am hope they eventually get it right as visions are good, but execution poor. I had to change my return flight from Copenhagen. Changing the BA return was more expensive (one star to them) than a one way with SAS or Norwegian ..  which were the same. Norwegian was an hour earlier, which would take ne home for dinner time. So the choice was Norwegian although I do not earn any meaningful miles. But . ... Norwegian was 1.5 hours delayed as they were missing a crew that would fly the plane 😡 SAS departed on time .. so in hindsight that would have been a better choice. There was no wifi on the Norwegian flight 😖 But last time I tested them there was ... but the lack of speed made it useless. The response was too slow ... but still to fast for a meaningful power nap - lol😃 It will take I while before I test them again.
I have bought my light bulps at Firstlight for a few years, and have always been happy with selection, pricing and delivery. Early on the website was not that easy to navigate and product photos/drawing was a bit challenging. But, that has improved. Also international delivery has worked fine.
I bought 24 bottles of Primitivo di Manduria Sessantanni 60 Feudi Apulien Italien ... a fantastic wine from Italy, which however, from time to time is difficult to find, and if findable, then it is very expensive. I found it at Hanseaten Select for at good price (compared to Danish prices anyway) and with enough bottles in stock to make a fast delivery. There was a little credit card hick up, but I am actually not sure what caused it. The goods were delivered without any further delay.  I will delfinitely shop there again.
Hi - I placed my order & received fast delivery. I needed a short HDMI extender, and AV-Cables sold me a quality cable. I am very pleased with AV Cables. I can definitely recommend them...

Order 1: Jeans was different sizes and 1 pair jeans was wrong Order 2: I received what i ordered Order 3: I received a wrong pair of jeans. I like the shop, and the jeans was cheap, but many problems yeah..
Good prices and fast shipment, what else a happy customer may need?
I ordered electronics from outside of EU, paid for delivery, and was ready to pay for toll. A week after delivery, I received a bill from FedEx, stating double amount to be payed for toll. The reason for double amount is "administration expenses" - that's exactly how a delivery company should make money. I, as a customer, do not care about any expenses above what I already paid for delivery and toll.
Best prices, compared to other online stores in the category. Fast delivery to the door for the same price others ask for GLS "somewhere delivery".
Ones writing about poor signal should read first how GSM/3g works. Oister uses 3's Network, and I, as user of 3 as well do not see any difference in connection quality. Despite claimed almost 100% coverage, there are obviously some "Black holes". One can try using external antenna to improve connectivity instead of blaming hardware. Oister price/value for 3g/3.5g connectivity is among the best in DK. It's even possible to use VPN on dynamic public IP (via a dynamic DNS service) using Oister, while it does not work on other mobile broadband providers. The only disadvantage is the company web site. I find it slow and buggy - please improve. I’m very happy with the service. Recommended.
I have placed an order in November 2012, everything was delivered quickly and works as expected - no surprises here. However, my Credit Card has been charged for this order only in the end of December. I find such a billing approach totally inappropriate. Also contacting support proves other reviews - it's useless.
I have ordered so-dimm ram from Merlin, and waited two weeks to have it delivered. Not only I waited way too long, but also the package stated "ProShop" instead of "Merlin". What's the reason using Merlin than?

I ordered a dress and a shirt at http://chicperks.com in december 2013. The dress was meant to be used at new years eve. But I never heard anything about the shipping of the dress so I had to buy a new one. They transferred the money from my account in the beginning of January but at the website the status of the shipment was the same "unfulfilled". At the beginning of January 2014 I send an e-mail saying that I wanted the whole order to be canceled. I have not received anything. They wrote me back  10 days later with a "Hello Monica" - my name is NOT Monica, and this message: "If you like we can ship you our Deep V Backless Black Dress with our next shipping batch and refund your Paypal account for the Essential Striped Button-Down Shirt. Please let us know if this is ok?" I wrote them back same day: "Im no longer interested in any of the items. Please dont send them and please refund the money. Would you like my account number or do you have it already? And when can I expect the money back?" I think my first and second reply to them were pretty simple... Then they wrote: "Some of the items from order #1795 have now been shipped: 1x Deep V Backless Black Dress - One Size" SO: they have now sent money back (28 USD) for the shirt, but not for the dress, and they send the dress, even though I three times have asked them NOT to send and to send BACK my money. Now I have to wait for the dress and pay the shipping back myself. Please never buy from this site, and never write them - unless your name is Monica!

Apple has cared for me as a customer and for servicing the products I have bought from them over the years. Really, it seems like every time it has been necessary for me to request support from their Technical or Customer Service -Teams (which only has been three times in Ten years --with 8 products), so yes, every time it seems that the Apple-team took the occasion as an opportunity to go beyond what can be expected. They solve problems, hold their word and communicate back to you, when on one occasion there was a delay, informing you of status, next step and new ETA. That is the way to set expectations! Apple even follow up on they courier-service of delivery, so that Apple does control the end-to-end experience. Apple is just first class.
While you are still capable of delivering flowers (which after all, is the foundation of your business) actually doing something meaningful with the "add-on" gifts you propose and charge steep fees for is something that Interflora still needs to work hard on! (how can you deliver a "hand-made" card without inserting the message I input on your form --and for which you HAVE charged me? It is just bad web-business practice that you don't have a build-in trigger that goes off against the query: "a card without a message? " ! Fix it and I will be back.

PostDK has always been slow to understand an adapt to customer demands. Recent product addition, which competitors have had for some time already, allows cheaper shipping to local supermarkets, instead of directly to the address during a time window where you are never home anyway. Good to see this, but competitors are still ahead.
Bought a set of carpets for my SAAB 9-5 from SpeedParts swedish website, they were, (and are still as of today 11JUL 2013) -clearly marked as "Original SAAB" and therefore quite expensive compared to an aftermarket copy from any other automotive shop. Shipment was ok, but I got a huge surprise when opening the package: The "original SAAB carpets" are just like any other generic set... I immediately took contact to Speedparts support, they were polite, but however insist the carpets are original because I quote them: "There is a sticker with the SAAB part number on the back and no-one complained before" End of quote. A sticker on an unoriginal part does not make it an original part, Speedparts! I have returned the carpets at great cost, on top they claim 12% handling when an item is returned.... Well, I can only say: If you are looking for a non-original item for your car, I guess you are ok, but don't buy and pay for something they claim is "original" because you will be left standing with the bill when what you buy does not fit your car as an original item would have done. Highly discourage anyone from using this website for original items. Best regards
Great service so far. I was skeptical, but if they can keep it up I might stick with it!
I would recommend them to anyone. The best cdkey company I have tried so far.
I bought a srtaightening iron (GHD Mini) from Nicehair.dk. I was called right next day regarding a comment or question I wrote at the "notes" section. I had the product in 2 days. Excellent, very fast service. I also got a small extra present additional to what I have ordered, which was actually already on sales.

After four visits to Kath in Flensburg I can without any doubt claim that this is the place of the poorest mechanics and service-level I have ever experienced (and I’ve tried a lot). At first everything seems nice and they treat you well. However when they are to do the job it all falls down. All four times I’ve visiting Kath in Flensburg the mechanics has “forgotten” to fix the error, ordered home wrong parts, been unable to fix the problem or they say that they've fixed it only for me to experience that the error has not been fixed at all. All this while they know I’m driving 300 KM to get there each time, and I’ve made it clear in advance that it’s very important that they are able and ready to fix all the discussed items of that reason. Already shaken by the incompetence described above you can also look forward to an insulting level of service from Kath Auto Gruppe, when you point out these errors to them. They have no care what so ever for you and your car, when the payment has been completed, and they deny any kind of help/refund even though it's clear that they haven't even been close to do their job right. I have tried to reach out to them several times before writing this review. My advice would be to choose all other places to get your car repaired than at Kath Gruppe - this is one big scam if you ask me.
