All the time they were really nice and trying to solve any question or problem. They send my pen really fast after I payed and they give me a track number to follow it (and also the web I had to check it!) Few days after that, arrived my pen and all was perfect. The pen is just unbeatable and my boyfriend is like crazy with it. I really recommend Cult pens!! thank you for everything!
The size info on the website is extremely confusing, especially if you are buying a present for somebody else. After a very slow delivery, when your package arrives and the contents don't fit, you have two choices: 1. Do nothing and throw it away. 2. Start the complex return procedure and pay an expensive international shipping that is almost as expensive as the product itself. It's not that I won't buy again here, it's that I won't buy Crocs at all since I hate this brand now.
The quality of the products is lately lower. It might have been that I tried new items that I didn't like. I'll stick with those I know. It would be easier to choose if you had more samples, suggestions or packs to tryout new things.
Camelbak Mule. Found the store searching for this item. Best price, even shipping to Spain. Friendly web and fast email information of purchase. I received the package in few days, before than my wife's bought at a spanish web ;D Thank you very much
As a company we have been trying to get our products published but we have unable to do so because of: - Agents constantly changing - Different requirements depending on the day - Inefficent communication NOT RECOMMENDED
The range of SEO tools available are great and recommendations actionable. My only concern is price - too expensive for small companies
I occasionally buy warhammer 40k related books in local bookstores but in Black Library I found all the books available which was great! Additionally, delivery was really fast and cheap even out of UK
I am one of those people who hates going shopping. Therefore, Tailor4Less is a great option to buy my clothes online. Taking my own measurements seemed as a big deal at the beginning but it is really easy. I had some doubts and I contacted their customer service and they were very helpful Recommended
The products is more cheaper for the similar products of the brand products
It was a very big order and I didn´t trust it was going to arrive the day I was told. I was really surprised because it came It was exactly what I ordered
i was trying to contact since wednesday because a product comes withs scratches and they don't answered to me yet, please contact me at xamponin@hotmail.com
I've been using Chemist Direct for about four years now.  The prices are great compared to the high street and my order always arrives within a couple of days; I've even had items sent abroad!  Overall an excellent websight!
Good looking thermometer for the price, even though it's not the same as the one shown in centigrade. However it is good value and was received very quickly.
I’m really happy to have found 888games. I have visited a lot of this type of sites, but I can sincerely say that 888 can’t be compared to anyone of the others, the great variety of games that this site offers and the experience I have lived is totally recommended for everyone.
10 days after ordering a costume, still no estimated shipping date. Nothing. They do not state in the product description nothing about the long delivery times, they didn't even warn me of long delivery time at the time of placing the order. But they charge 50% cancellation fee. So no matter what, they have a guaranteed income of 50% of all their orders. Good policy (for them).
Delievery times, sales and prices are not the best, but I always find on the web anything that cannot find in other online shops. So I take always CRC  on my list to compare prices and services when looking for an article. CRC is a realiable online shop. I use the website for buying online with other 4 shops since 4 years. And still find it good.
I bought from them several times, very good customer service and prompt deliveries. Very recommended.
I paid, spent my money and boohoo did not send the items bought
It arrives in 2 days as they say on the web, also good quality products.
If you are a gram counter, this is a superb website for purchasing and comparing products. They give you all the details you need plus some opinions about items that may help you to ease your load or improve your outdoors expereince.
I strongly recommend purchasing in Outdoorgb. They have competitive prices and the delivery outside the UK is very fast (within a couple of days). It is very a interesting site for outdoors products that are not available at your own country. I have already ordered several times and I will keep on doing so. Excellent!
I have bought in Wiggle since 2009 and my experience was positive in all cases. For me key point is the oportunity of change the products without problem. Also the prices are very competitive
To me the Aramis 900 series has always stood out as being a particularly special fragrance. I have always rated the Aramis products as being significantly better than similar products on the market and as a result have been a loyal customer for many years. Now being retired in Spain I have had great difficulty in finding an outlet which provides the 900 and as a result extremely pleased to have found Allbeauty as a supplier who provide an excellent service.
It was one of the few stores that have the item I wanted, but it took a lot to be delivered.
I notice an error in the description in the item, and asked beforehand to avoid issues. It took a long time to receive an answer. With the answer in mind, I placed the order and... I received the wrong size (just I have warned the shop). After contacting the company and setting a complaint, getting the 1st answer kind of "is your problem", and waiting for so much time to give an answer... finally they send me the correct size. Finally I have what I ordered... but waiting for a long time, and after arguing with them. Please, make it easy for both.
I bought a swimmsuit for my girlfriend and she is delighted with it. The price was quite good, so the delivery was.
First of all I love that i could purchase 25 USB sticks and not 100. It took a while to get the sticks as I wanted to but the wait was worth it. The sticks look amazing and really professional. I really recommend USB2U for any USB imprints!!
I reserved a language course abroad easily and flawlessly but suddenly I realized that I put incorrect start dates on my booking details. I just contacted the staff on the site and my booking was fixed within minutes. Thank you LanguageBookings!
Although I have not seen the flowers myself, as they were sent to my sister in England, she assures me that they are beautiful, and a very welcome 'Thank you'. She should know, as she has had experience of  flower arrangement helping in her daughter's business at one time. She is delighted with them. Thank you, Teleflorist.
Easy to order. Good selection. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to keep the recipient home for delivery, and the lack of a calling-card meant that I had to ring her a lot later to tell her where her flowers were. Kind of spoiled the surprise.
Fast delivery, although items missed original packaging (logical - less weight, less delivery costs) it is no big deal, as the cardboard boxes would have ended in the recycling bin. Great prices and some unknown brands which produce really good looking articles (MSC) Overall, 4.5/5. Would give it 5/5 if I had had a discount or voucher, but cannot have everything!!
im verry happy got the card in 3 days verry good site
Why don't you try HiFX?  It's simple to do and you can get the best rate.
We're Molo fans, my kids love the cool designs and I love the quality! I always buy at Littlesunflowers because they have the best price and selection! Their customer service is very helpful and shipping is fast. I also love the flower credits rewards ; )
I needed some name tags for Elias school uniform and this website came up, they delivered to Spain and allowed accents so I chose them. I bought a nursery pack, it's not bad but I am finding I need a few more iron on labels... I would have loved the option of pick and mix I would have had ordered more iron labels than stick on ones. The case it comes in is great for keeping everything all together. All in all a good experience and I would use this company again.
I will order with myprotein, but i will never order anytime to probike. Very bad web and bad return policy.
I bought a pair of boots and I didn't remember to choose the free gift. I wrote to Country Attire and Katie resolved my mistake quickly,send me the free gift . Thanks a lot for all,Katie
I have used hostelwordl to book some accomodations in places i have visited, i have to say that i will continue using it because it is always reliable.
Good price they are very good on service I had a problem with last battery's they fix it .
I have traveled with housetrip to Paris, Lisbon and Venice and it has been a great experience, I will definitely continue with it!
Everything has been fine with the process of shopping and with the purchased items but it took too much to receive them. There have been some problems with the transportation. After some 10 days without notice, I contacted Golfstore and I was phoned by the transport company. The said that they got home but there was nobody. On the other hand, they asked me for the address because acording to them it was no complete... Finally, I went to the wareshouse and picked up the parcel.
I work out pretty often but I don't always take the time to eat before going to the gym, so I started drinking Herbalife prior to my workout to make up for it. I've lost a little bit of weight, (3 pounds after a little more than two weeks), with the shake but only when I combined it with Green Coffee Bean Extract was I able to lose weight a lot faster (down another 8 pounds after just under 2 weeks). I feel better more oftern now and I'm also looking a lot more toned! Another problem of mine is that I love sweets, but the Herbalife and GCBE help keep me from having hunger pangs. I recommend to anyone the Herbalife's products and Try-Herbal.Com
Effortless is a good lerning course, but in my case I had a lot of trouble to downloads the lessons to my phonemobile.
All has gone great. Was looking for these earrings for my wedding day and were exhausted in Spain. Very fast delivery and item authentic and quality! Thank you very much!
It was an incredible fast transaction. Th e web itself has al ot of good quality items with incredible prices. Junkyards sends my order really fast and It arrives in 6 days via UPS to Spain. I'm really happy with the buy. A++++++++ Seller!!!
Order received with 5 days. Everything wonderfully packaged and arrived in one piece (even the biscuits were perfectly preserved!) I liked the personal touches, for example, the name and photo of the person who prepared my package. I contacted customer services twice and they were brilliant; once by the live chat on the website and again by email. Both received quick and efficient responses. The communication was perfect and I got an email each time there was an update about my order. The prices are extremely competitive and although some products may appear cheaper on rival sites, the shipping is usually much higher than British Corner Shop. I also thought the idea of the 'virtual box', showing you exactly how much space you have left, was ingenious. You can also sign up and receive extra credits for writing reviews and a good there's a good loyalty scheme. All in all, I have only positive things to say about this fantastic company and have already recommended it to all my friends. Keep up the good work, British Corner Shop, we salute you!
I had some doubts and the staff resolved 100%. A very reliable shop!
I have now been using on a regular basis Arguscarhire for over 2 years, during this period I have rented cars for several consecutive months, and in those cases where the car rental company that rented, provided a poor service, by phoning in Arguscarhire (or Cartrawler being the same thing) everything was rapidly solved). I warmly recommend Arguscarhire to anyone.
Bought a dehumidifier from this company. Item working really well and we are very pleased. Would not hesitate to use this company again. Customer service and delivery very good.
We ordered a multi-colour felt ball rug 2 weeks ago and we already received the rug today. We got a personal message from an employee of Feltballrug.com with the tracking information, which was nice. But most importantly, the rug is just stunning and looks much better than on the pics on their website! And my children just absolutely love it!
I bought some products from a brand impossible to buy from here in Europe (Anastasia Beverly Hills). My order came in no time, with very interesting samples and my products, all extremely well packaged and secured. I would definitely recommend this website to anyone!
My order was set up on Monday evening and the parcel arrived in Spain nine days later (instead of 3-4 days!). The long delivery time is a "no go" for me. Also the communication / information were not at a standard level. I got an email for my order. I got an email that my items are depending. I never got an email that my parcel were send out, also I could never track my parcel. When I send an request via email, I got the information, but never the track number for the parcel. In short: The price for the items are unbeatable, delivery time and information level regarding the state of affair was poor. Service via email was better, but it is always better to avoid this way, because a standard order should go a standard way.
I was looking to avoid the extorsive daily excess insurance coverage car rental companies sell you at the counter to waive liabilities not covered by the standard basic coverage included in the rental price. iCarhireinsurance offered more than I was looking for and for the price of less than 3 days excess charge from the rental company I bought a whole year. Offering a lot more. No contest. I hope I will never need it. So far I haven't and don't know how iCarhireinsurance will respond in case I ever file a claim. But if they respond anywhere near the efficiency and professionalism of their website, I won't have any problems.
I have a good experiencia surfing the web. I have to wait to recieve my shoes to have a complete valoration.
I order from Spain  a pair of pedals  and in 5 days i received the stuff in perfect condition, ,i reccomend the online shop to everyone.
It's a pleasure to buy things in places like this.
from my experience, is a great company that fulfills its commitment to fast on shipping
Not much more to add, been a regular customer for quite a few years now and buying from zavvi.com is as easy as it gets. Great prices, really good promos and shipping is amazingly fast! What else can you ask for? :D
I read some of the reviews here and understand that renting a car can be a tricky operation. Mostly because of the car renters themselves, they make it confusing so that the customer pays as much as possible for peace of mind. I know this because I work in the industry!! In many cases that I read here, I can tell that the customer did not pay close attention and, unfortunately, we have to. Nature of the beast, I am afraid. But when it comes to the website, I had no doubt which to use before landing in Gatwick. CHM is right now the best in the market, hands down. It has a clear user experience design, the purchase flow is easy, their offers are excellent, their ancillary products the best and my experience with customer service has been, so far, spotless. That´s the reason why when friends ask me what to use, I send them here. Any of the other aggregator sites will make things way more complicated, I know this well. CHM uses some of the best rental agencies in the world, but they have no control if they are still pushy, sometimes even shoddy in their dealings. Don´t kill the messenger, type of thing. I will continue using, for sure.
Bought a Parker Ingenuity 5th, as I already own one, I wanted the same model in another colour.  Very easy to find anything you want/need on the website, easy to use and easy to buy. Excellent follow up of the shipment which needed to travel from UK to Spain where this item was at least 20% more expensive. Arrived in approx 4-5 days. Absolutely no hassle.  Questions via the contact email were resolved efficiently and quickly. I have another order planned already.
As I state above, I paid on the Thursday morning money was in my foreign account Friday (Spain) although not promised until Tuesday 9AM. I got a great rate and it was only 1 cent behind a very current rate after paying fees. I've not manage that since buying over here and that was a lot more money!
Bad experience, the worst I have ever had with an internet company. My history is similar as most of people here. I ordered a table clock in INFURN.com, in the spanish platform at the beggining of May 2013. My first surprise after payment  was the delivery time, 8 months, which i found excesive. As i still had not received anything in July I contacted them and their excuses were "delivery problems but you will receive your order in September". Of course i didn't receive anything apart excuses so in December I claimed for my money back. The 6th of January they confirmed me by email i would have my money returned by 30 days. Finally I can confirm I have received my money 14th of February so I feel relieved, but anyway Infurn has to improve A LOT  it financial, customer and logístic service which are a disaster. Good Luck to everyone 18.02.2014 Dear Jesica, Just to point out: 1.Today i have had my bank confirmation of refund so i have changed my comments 2.You say i have not contacted with Infurn since January. This is not true. I save all emails and I can give you details by date. I have contacted you 4 times since January and you have only called me today: *05.02.2014   Case 00007369 *09.02.2014   Case 00011244 *13.02.2014   Case 00016371 Case 00016372
Una pasada el precio, la rapidez y todo lo q hay en la página
I am very glad with my purchase. I can´t ask for more.
Very complete catalog, very competitive prices, interesting web site, not only to buy, also to learn. I have several web providers for bike parts and I always require shipment to Spain. Many times the small increase of the shipping costs from UK is more than compensated with the Merlin Cycles good prices. When looking for very special parts (not so commonly used) is when Merlin Cycles becomes more and more competitive.
In my many years of investing I have never before been lucky enough to meet anybody who actually looks after my financial future in the way that Liam Speake does. After nine disastrous years with another well known financial company (that cost me hundreds of thousands of pounds) it was a blessing to find a gentleman who not only said he would look after my finances but actually proved that this indeed is what would happen. My five star rating says it all. There is nothing I can add other than to wish Liam all the best for the future and to hope that for a long time to come he will be the person who secures the future for my wife and myself.
Three days after ordering the flascards on the Spanish website,they were delivered at my adres in Holland. I was not expecting them so soon
Fast service, trustful, this is the second time I have order from them but it won't be the last. Excellent include non UK delivery.
Very good experience. Better if it is not your first stay at NY, because you know the best places , but  now I can go to those places a litlle uncommon but nice to know them. And no need to spend a lot of money, it is no expensive, is affordable. You also need several days of stay , is better for a good use of the pass.
I have used alpharooms for many years and have never had any problems. Easy to use website and speed. Would recommend and use alpharooms again.
With this financial trading website in my hand do my financial operations more faster that visit a bank, and I can follow all movements at the indices.
First, I added a negative review, but after communication with the seller I must repaired my reviews like positive. The seller sent the goods, but the goods were lost due to the post office. Seller filed a complaint after the agreement, but the product could not be traced. On request, the seller returned the money paid including the postage. Sellers thank you very much, and I am very sorry for inconvenience.
Several times I bought from the dealer and everything was absolutely perfect. Seller definitely very much I recommend to all customers.
just get on the website and get it booked. You won't find better value so don't look anywhere else.
Delivery times are excellent. Goods and offers are really good.Would certainly recommed Home base for quality and service
The 2 floral arrangements i ordered for my family were absolutely gorgeous. They arrived as ordered and both family members were delighted with them Many thanks to Sophie @ eflorist,we have always got our flowers from there and have never bee disappointed. Well done !! We award you 5 stars
I liked making the purchase at this store, very good service and a lot of product to choose I recommend it 100%
I bought 2 dresses in this shop, it was my first purchase. The next day, I received a mail telling about the shipment, and they sent me a tracking numer, so I could follow my order. In the checkout process, I got disappointed because if I used a voucher code, I could not get free shipment (as have de european shipments of more than 25€). About the dresses, one of them made me feel a bit dissappointed, because the fabric is quite thin, but it does not show through at all.
The best products at good price with fast sending. What else can you want?!
Huge range of golf items, so it a store to be always taken into account.
My wife and I used the New York Pass in the more importants atractions in NY, thanks for de experience.
It was fast but they haven't got the plant i had asked for. Instead of it, they gave me the choice for another different plant, which it was fine. I asked for the deliver guy to sing a short song but he didn't. It's ok (actually I don't know if I had song neither!) Great service! (plant was "sent" from Spain to Sweden!!)
The gold car office is too far from the airport ! You need 45 minutes to give back the car ( arrival , wait for the bus , going to the air port with the bus) To pick up the car , you wait too long .( 30 minutes )
They sent me the wrong part, although it was not wrong part but wrong settings from the computer descripttion.v they replace them for the right ones in almost not time from the customer service. nice to find a place in which you can trust.  five starts
nearly 30 days I'm waiting that I get my order ,in customer care tell me that they do not send by plane, to wait for me to arrive by land (that does not expecifican on their website) the day 04/04 / 2014 A month ago I placed my order, and not where it is, very dissapointing
Good products at fair prices - But the control panel is a bit complicated until you get into it. But overall I am happy with them, and can def. give them 4 stars.
I really enjoy doing the courses in E-careers and I look forward to do more. In the beggining I had some problems to log in in on of the courses, and they help me a lot till they sort it out. Also they give you a long term for complete your course, and you can get rasonable prices once you are register with them. Thank you E careeers Andrea Nogales Carmona
I didn´t get the item, It was an special delivery paid more than a month ago, the don´t keep any record from the item, you cannot follow a track number or anything, they where keep on saying I had to wait. Is been more than I MONTH i did my payment and nothing, finally they refund the money (but I didn´t ask them to do it) I WANT MY ITEM AND I DIDN´T GET IT, NOT RECOMENDABLE!
One pedal box was broken and  the other pedals was missing a pair of cleats. The two boxes have a aspect of use, may be the pedals are from exposure.
unpresentable. first and last order. Offered 5 kg of protein at 45 eur and when I get the package I sent only 2.5. thinking it was a mistake I look online and I realize that's happened to more people and that, conscious of their fault they have done nothing to cancel the order or notify you in case you're interested. send you the 2.5 kg of protein at a high price when you bought 5, paypal claim and if not do very well to his facebook wall. I see in other scores above that has been the same if you want to return the order for his failure 7 eur charge you and you return the money when they want. NEVER AGAIN, THANKS FOR MAKE ME LOSE THE TIME AND MONEY
I wrote a review after buy in a shop and they deleted after some days.
I love the site. The choice is incredible, the prices are really good and the service is fantastic. The order arrived much earlier than expected. I will surely buy again.
You should really try it. I got myself 2 pair of boots from the sales and they arrived very quickly , one pair didn't suit me and already back in the post. All went smoothly. Even got personal e-mail back after telling them. They seem to look after their customersvery well  and that is a big plus to me.
Everything went easy according to what I expected and trouble free, even when I went to collect . Only reserve is that they wouldn't deliver to an other address than the one used from the bank details  which meant collection was necessary for me. Finding the use easy and would definitely recommend it.
The best thing you can say about a casino online is that it is honest and 888casino under my experience is the most honest of all. Also this web offers many possibilities of gambling -from a minimum bet to a lot of money-, a fantastic selection of games and it's easy to register as both begin to play and win money. I encourage you to take a look at 888casino.
Fast  international service. The only place I found the spare part I needed. They do things the way it becomes clear and easy to buy online.
Although the item I ordered was out of stock it did not take long to get the part in and delivered to Spain. Thank you . 2nd time I have ordered a part and both were handled very efficiently.
I have been using Venere's services for years and never had the faintest issue at all. I trust quite much other users' opinions, so far it has been a very reliable source for selecting hotels. Complimenti, Venere!
I have used Serenata Service for Birthday flowers and for a Christmas Hamper gift and I was, and more importantly, the recipient , was not disappointed. The hamper of wine and other seasonal goodies was described as excellent, and the flowers described as beautiful. Delivery was prompt and efficient. I think that Serenata go to a lot of trouble to ensure that their clients are satisfied. Thank you.
Need to improve the packaging. Your shipping charges are expensive if you compare with others shops in uk. Please use double boxed for protect the og box in shoes orders. My box camin bad conditions. Thanks
I'm still waiting for my order, almost 140€ and no reply yet to my last email. I'm not able to explain how upset and dissapointed I am with your service
I'm really glad to find this shop online and to buy my fork in it. The costumer service is fantastic, fast and really trust. I'm sure than I'll buy some things for me and my bike in Merlin Cycles.
Everything was so easy - I did have a slight problem but they were able to sort it out immediately. Very efficient.
Being a poor expat, I desperately need a place to find decent, yet cheap, housing on my multiple backpacking adventures. hostelworld.com consistently tells me that, despite my bulimic bank account and sad looking credit card statements, I am still able to stay off the streets when I travel! Fear not! There is a shower and a warm bed in every city that you want to visit! And no matter if you're able to look for something more luxurious (my OWN room and bathroom and FREE breakfast...WHAT?!?!) or just trying to find a place to sleep that is better than a cardboard box, hostelworld.com will make you happy :)
Boozt is a great place to shop, the best brands,great prices and very good customer service.
Nice place to buy peculiar  t-shirts (including some winking eye to the comics world). I wish they had more stuff! you can also submit ideas
We all know Vodafone is a giant in mobile communication. I used Vodafone in other countries and I've been pretty satisfied with service provided and competitive rates. So I decided to get a Vodafone top-up card in Spain. Can't complain about the network but what is really annoying are the following flaws: 1- Getting bombarded with sms-advertising with little chances to opt-out (online) 2- Having the option to top-up online in my Vodafone menu that is not really available to use (confirmed by a Vodafone dealer). Every time you have to go to a kiosk (stand in the queue as there's no machine top-up yourself). And the Vodafone agent has to write down every single time your number in a piece of paper before topping up (and I am not happy having them keeping my number as it may be read by other people walking in the store)
Good combo deals for Internet + Land line for 40 Eur/mon. (didn't have a tv). Being an expat didn't make sense to pay expensive  tv-license for 3 channels in English :-) Never had internet down (in 12 months). Only drawback you cannot get UPC all over Ireland (as a matter of fact, some quite central areas of Dublin are not reached yet but they are expanding quite quickly). Phone customer service + recollecting modem is a poor service (had a few issues while moving). However Twitter profile was very reactive replying and solving my issue while terminating my contract. Good work Social Media Team.
Nice online comic strips generator. The idea is very nice, so if you get a nice joke you can actually turn it into a comic book. There's a free version with limited characters and templates. Quite easy to use. You need a premium version to unleash all the features. Good if you need a quick comic strip for fun or personal use. I wish it had more features like insert links, create custom urls more basic templates for the free version.
IF you just got contacted by a recruiter or you are at an advanced stage Glassdoor might be very useful to look at. You can get an overall rating and useful info (not corporate and biased self praising stuff) about how it is to actually work for a company. You can select the location, and read comments from actual or former employees. Very useful also to know if the wages are in line with the market and also if the salary offered to you  is within the range of other employees with the same title working for the company (or that worked in the past). I always check it before changing job. It also has a job search/alert function so you can receive new jobs alerts in your inbox.
Series: If you enjoy tv-series it is definitely worth to try if you are a series freak: it is best for tv-series you can watch all the seasons in high quality. Never had a problem with streaming. Always smooth and if you pause it next day it will start again from where you were. Documentaries: it is quite ok with documentaries and "docutainment". Movies: not the latest, best or blockbusters movies. IF you are cinema lover, might be worth to try other services, I hope they'll improve the database. First trail month is free, a few euros a month (it is only offered in a few countries yet).  I had it for a 3 months than cancelled subscription
The alltricks website is very intuitive and clear, and a vast catalogue of products. I purchased Shimano components with very low price . The delivery is carried out within the deadlines set and everything arrived in perfect condition. 10 for ALLTRICKS!
Website was good, staff on the phone very helpful. Easy to locate desk in airport and also location of car.
Had some questions and needed to speak to an operator not only is the number free but the operators are excellent. Documents required when picking up needs to be clearer especially the difference between a UK or overseas resident.
I bought this as an intended replacement for an old Flymo strimmer whch used a nylon line as the cutter. The Gtech, although light, was awkward to hold and even more difficult to keep on as the switch was not easy to hold on. But my biggest moan is hthat in the first ten minutes of use I had already"broken" two of the plastic cutting blades provided"free" for life( for £2.95 P & P). These blades just clipped the lawn edging, stones, and  just broke up. At least with Flymo the nylon line survives much better. If Gtech can come up with a version which has a nylon line reel instead of those useless plastic blades I 'd buy one.
We parked at Paige Airport parking near Luton Airport. Excellent service and prompt pick up atthe airport on our return. Will definitely use them again
I got a good Euro rate and the cash was delivered by Special a Royal Mail delivery as requested. A good Company to do business with
I think that you can sent, inside the box of the order, a samples to others products or merchandising presents. I'm a freelance stylist. I ask to you for that sent voucher codes or additional discount for my orders (I will buy more in your web) In general ggod price and service for me ;) See you
I'm from Spain and I hadn't bought on Gameseek previously. I ordered from them for the first time an item, the order was shipped quickly and I was informed of everything until the package arrived. I'm really satisfied with their service, I would recommend them to other people.
Hostelworld has helped me with my bookings in both Europe and Asia. Most of the time I have had good experiences with my bookings. The process is simple, easy and fast. However, I relay a great deal on other traveler's reviews. What I dislike is when people write about their lives without any objectivity at all about the specific place you're looking up. Hostelword could make an effort to try to limit or eliminate that kind of reviews.
I was sent notification on order, when my order left and when and how it arrived. I was able to track my order too. What a brilliant service. Very happy
Hi I have now used 'my tuxedo' a few times! With no probs! I first had a tux jacket that didn't fit! because I needed it urgent, they sent another size before receiving back the first one!! they also paid my postage back! well done my tuxedo!
So they sent me an email that they would refund my order, that would be nice if it wasn't because I never asked them to cancel my order in the first place, I don't know what happened, but 2 weeks have passed and no deliver is sent to me...Obviously I had to buy my stuff in another company, this is no serious business...
So when I got to pay my order, an error appeared, so I tried in total 3 times, when I went to my credit card account to my surprise they charged me with the 3 payments...but that's not the worse thing..when I go to my Bulkpoweders order history, there is none order, as if nothing happened... I won't even receive for what i've paid.
I´m happy with the service and the price but the product itself was not good at all. The audio throught this wire doesn´t sound good enough,. Neither the video looks like proper hdmi conection, it has an important lack of definition.
a process perfectly coordinated with any problem, and quick solution.
I've bought several times in amazon and it has allways beeb a good shopping experience
I am so pleased with this firm - they do all they can to help - if they have your produckt BUY FROM THEM
I am a regular client of Jokers for a few years now, always been extremely happy with their service, never had any problems with their service, what you see on the website is what you get. Highly recommend them.
Had used Azimo several times without a problem to send money to Argentina at very favourable rate.  Issue only came when had a problem and tried to speak to customer services.  Called at least 4 times and could never get past receptionist.  Took approx 4 hours for someone to call back.  Very frustrating and expensive when in a foreign country.  Such a shame as otherwise would say service is outstanding.
It is a good way to get a game for a little price. In ten minutes after buying it, i had the game in my pc. No problems. The game works perfectly. I will surely buy again in this web.
I was hesitant to buy these shoes because I had not seen in reality. Once it  has arrived and I have tried it, I am very happy. It is very comfortable, low weigh and it seem very sturdy. The buying process seems phenomenal. A great price and perfect delivery. Thank you very much to store. Very very recommended.
It is not the first time I buy from this store. I received a defective item, but I contacted with support service and got a replace soon. The quality of the replace wasn't great neither, so I guess I just picked the wrong model... anyways, happy with the kind service :)
Excellent product, swift delivery, clear concise web page and easy to print documentation, plus Complete Care Shop advised me of the despatch and expected date of delivery as well as asking me to contact them if there were any problems at all, and best of all the product is a good fit for Mums wheelchair
I bought a North Face ski jacket at a great price.  The speed and efficiency of the service would leave me in no hesitation to use Taunton Leisute again. Thank you!
The whole process was made very easy thanks to the excellent service provided by Shaban. He was knowledgeable about the product, offered constructive suggestions to get us the right package at the right price, showed patience when we messed up with our information and delivered all of this with great professionalism and a touch of humour.
It is a good website but not all products are well priced.
Very satisfied with the service provided, easy to use booking system and  near instant confirmation of reservation
Other times I had problems with a warranty of a frame. And in other order I recieved an incorrect product.
TransferWise has the best exchange rates, even taking into account the small Commission. It is fast and I am very pleased with the service. I would definitely recommend it!
its easy and quick... the customer service is good too. I will repit.
us was very easy and fast to buy the tickets we wanted. really very good
Never had any problems, order always arrived on time and in good condition
I purchased the 3 day Berlin pass, and as I said everything worked as advertised. I recommend a lot this bundle. Keep working this way.
fast delivery - and articles as promised on the Web-site.
It cost £52.00 to hire a car for majorca for 7 days. I arrived and was told by the rentalcar place i need to pay €88.00 (£74.00) for the full tank. I said i would return it full. He said at first i couldnt take the car and i needed to pay. We debated. He then said if i returned it full i would still have to pay the €88.00. So i was forced to pay. The xar came with cdw but said ut didnt cover small things like tyres / windscreen. The guy then  said i wasnt fully insured; if i had a crash i would have to pay €19,000.00 approx for the car but i could avoid this by paying another €11.00 per day.  He said the CDW did not cover hardly anything and showed me a long list (not sure what the cdw did cover!!). I rang rentalcars in the uk who said i was insured. So i declined the insurance. He promptly said well you will pay then and if you break down also you will pay tow fees mechanic fees and damage". He was the most arrogant man and took great pleasure in telling me this. At one point he refused to complete the transaction unless i rang the uk. I have since emailed uk seeking reassurance and got an automated like response "sorry your experiencing probkems pkease email our team whdn you get back".  Complete failure to answer my questions and leave me worried sick. Terrible. Never again. Never.
Spent 850 pounds, on a bugaboo and car seat, and now the shop has gone into administrations.. Now have to deal with Visa to try to get my money back. And with few weeks ahead of the due date, find another pushchair!!!
I can understand a little damage after a few hours biking, but after one hour come back home with a sore, always in the same places is not an option for my wear, because after three or more hours I do not even want to think how the sore could put.
After being told that product was in stock, product was actually out of stock with estimated delivery time of 2 months. Order cancelled without a problem.
The quality of print is very good but several were folded when received.
hello I ordered yesterday at the Spanish store, and no one has contacted me.I'm waiting any response I want to order before December 31. Its all ok? thanks so much
Wanted to review a particular website, but just wanted to see all the 1* and 2* comments , rather than just the latest! couldn't find this option.   Amazon does this very well, and you get to read all the negative reviews about a product....very helpful. If this option is on the site then sorry for this review, but I couldn't find it, so perhaps it needs to be clearer and more intuitive....
I wanted to take two dogs on ferry from Palma to Barcelone,  couldn't book this online, (the website has no option for this) so I booked the tickets, cabin etc and then called the call centre, (10p per minute), held on the phone while she tried to book the dogs on the boat.  No response from ferry co.  so they have sent an email, now have to wait to ensure that they can travel.... Problem resolved by customer services....polite, helpful call centre assistant........  Though website still needs amending so that dogs can be added.... A lot of hassle, but Directferries at least solved the problem satisfactorily...
This is a scam site. They charge the money for the rooms, but no bookings are made and it is not possible to contact the company.
Ordered plane and hotel. One flight was changed, but it was impossible to get the confirmation for the new flight by e-mail, so we spent quite a long time with support, before this was done. This change also resulted in us being late for the next flight and we missed it and had to wait untill the next day for another flight. When we arrived at the destination, the hotel informed us that the reservation of the hotel had been cancelled by lastminute 4 days after it was booked. (trip was booked about 6 weeks before) lastminute never informed us about this. But still they had charged us for the hotel and the flights and we got on the plane and got to our destination, but because of a problem with the credit card (they said) our hotel reservation had been cancelled. So the credit card was ok to pay for the flights but not the hotel??? Spoke to them on the phone for dont know how long and they could not find our reservation, not the hotel, not the flights. So at 02.00 at night after about traveling for 20 hours, we decided to pay for a room and see if we could get things fixed in the morning. Next morning we spoke to the chat support and they found the reservation and finally things were fixed so we did not have to pay for the hotel again. So after missing more than a day of our vacation and spending dont know how long talking to their support and spending money on calling (roaming) support in our home country etc. we finally got to enjoy almost 2 weeks of vacation. I think we will order our vacation somewhere else next time.
I got the items I'd ordered without delay and without any hassles. Clear communication throughout the process. This is the second order I've placed with New Health Care. Based on my experience I'd certainly recommend their services.
I had to call in my order because I had a problem paying online. Apart from that, everything went smoothly. I haven't tried the tea yet.
I ordered some jalapeño and tomatillo seeds from them. My order was confirmed and delivered a couple of weeks later in Spain without any problems. More recently I placed a second order. Again the seeds were delivered promptly. Based on my experience, Sutton seems to be a serious, reliable company.
My order was confirmed promptly and delivered to me in Spain in less than a week. The Teeccino I ordered is as tasty a coffee substitute as you're likely to find. I'm having a cup of the English breakfast tea right now. It definitely leaves the usual PG Tips in the dust.
Always reliable in my experience. They got my money back for me when I ordered some swim goggles that were never delivered. If I'd paid by credit card, I suppose that wouldn't have happended.
In my case the order I placed (for a JD Bug scooter) was confirmed promptly and the item was delivered in less than a week (to Spain). So I have no cause for complaint.
I ordered some eartips from them. My order was confirmed promptly and I received the product without any problems or delay.
I received very prompt responses to a few questions I asked before placing my order. The shoes were shipped and delivered very quickly (to Spain).
I've placed many orders with amazon.co.uk and can't remember ever having a problem. The system they have for ordering used books from other suppliers (with clear information about user feedback) is great.
I did a Google search after ordering some swim goggles and running into problems. (The company I ordered from didn't confirm my order or answer their phone when I tried to call them. Neither was I able to reach them by Skype or e-mail.) My search led me to trustpilot.com, where I found several reviews from people who'd had similar experiences with the company I was dealing with. If I'd known about Trust Pilot  before ordering my goggles, I could have avoided the hassle. In short, my experience so far has been positive, and I think the site performs a valuable function.
My order was confirmed promptly and I received my goggles eight days after placing the order (delivered in Spain). I would definitely be happy to do business with this company again.
The item I ordered was shipped promptly. Communication was clear throughout the process, and when I requested an invoice with my Spanish VAT number, I got what I needed in about 15 minutes. Exactly the kind or service you want when you buy something online!
I've ordered items from them several times over the last few years. I've always found that the items were delivered promptly and in good condition. No cause for complaint in my experience!
18 November: Alarmingly I have received no confirmation of my order placed on 4 November. Neither have I received a response to an e-mail requesting confirmation. I have also tried repeatedly to contact the seller by phone and Skype: no one answers. As things stand I would warn people off this company. 19 November: Since posting my initial review above and making a claim via PayPal, I have received an answer to my e-mail query to the company. They say they did not get the prescription details when I placed the order and that they will now send the goggles ASAP. I will update this review again if/when I receive the goggles. For the record, I ordered a pair of swim goggles from the same site about two years ago and in that case I didn't have any problems with the order. 3 December: PayPal refunded my money, so I presume that they didn't receive a satisfactory answer from these people either. I haven't received the goggles or heard anything more from them since I sent my prescription details on 19 November. 12 December: In the end I gave up on this company and ordered my swim goggles from another site.
I've ordered a key that they had in stock but it seemed they not, so after writing an email asking for my key they told me that it will be at any moment now. It's been 4 days till the key arrived so please... If you don't have stock, just say it.
Really - can't help feeling sorry for these guys! I read trust pilot BEFORE ordering but decided - what the h... I'll try, - since I really loved the idea of the product I was ordering as a Christmas present It was an iPhone cover - and At the same time I decided to order one for myself The web page has a really nice design, easy to use - you can upload your own photos, change size, font, add text - you name it I found it very easy and quite awesome! It was funny designing your own stuff - I ordered only 8 days before Christmas - knowing that they are US- based I didn't count on the items making it - but they did The quality is VERY good and I really truly recommend zazzle .... Everybody keeps asking me about my cool phone cover :) Only difficulty: I needed to send the two phone covers to two different countries. Zazzle webpage says it's possible, but I couldn't make it work when I checked out Finally - I had them both shipped to Denmark - and my family sent mine to Spain afterwards - which didn't bother me much Try them - it's cool stuff!
I always make a reservations by means Hostelword, and I never had a problem with it. They have almost all the hostels existented. I always chech the reviews before to book, and I realize that all of them are real, Even they ask me about the hostels after to be at them.
Best prices good customers attention and fast shipment 100% recommendable
My order was a surprise for a family member and was delivered on time and in first class condition with with protective wrapping and full instructions included. I also recieved 5 emails making sure that everything was being done efficiently and on time. I wouldn't hesitate to use this company again.
Can't believe how quick our order was delivered, and so reasonable priced,certainly will use you again
very pleased with service after receiving shoes, which were too small, so having to change them, but have no printer, but my mind put at rest immediately with your "super rapido servicio".  Gracias!
I ordered the flowers from Spain, as a present to my girlfriend who is living in a residence in London, so everything was a big question mark. I am very happy with the results, everything was as expected, perfect. Thank you very much
Our experience was very good. Very efficient. And our airplanes of AA was better than all airplanes of spain. We was traveling in a delayed flight and we have to choose another to come to spain. The put a special bus to do not go across all airport and we was afraid of luggages, but the luggages arrive with us. No problem.
I bought a helmet on December 18 at fc-moto.de I had to return it. Now I have no helmet, I have no money and they do not answer emails. Today is February 18, 2 months waiting without notice of them.
