Booking is simple and all necessary info are provided and understandable.
i have shooped severel times from powermys and it has been perfekt service every time so i can recommend this Company to all of my frends!
I must say that Kvarneberg is very service minded and highly skilled. My very best recommendations!
i love shopping from you!! always getting my stuff in aprox a week. . it's so cheap too! i save a lot of money. i'm happy with my products as always!! they are so expensive in sweden. i have ordered a few times here yes..i'm a loyal customer who will shop again from you=)
I really like a lot the service at this store! I think this is the best that I ever had in Sweden. Thank you very much Kristina!
I've ordered stuff worth tens of thousands of pounds over the years, but since they scrapped the Super Saver Delivery to the EU they won't be getting any more of my custom. I'm not even sure why I'm bothering with this review, since I'm guessing Amazon reports all bad reviews to Trustpilot in order to censor them. But I've got to give them a piece of my mind.
Price match request worked without trouble. Delivery took 10 business days, which seems a long time for a shipment from the UK to Sweden. However not longer than stated for the free delivery option (max 10 business days), so I guess I shouldn't complain.
Could not have been happier, everything was as promised and I had my phone working within half an hour.
I've bought from Cheapsmells many times the last five years. It's amazing that most of the deliveries reach me faster than domestic mail (Sweden). The product range and prices are excellent, and I will keep returning to Cheapsmells since it's so convenient and fast. Thank you for a great website!
Great prices and fast delivery. No extra charge for delivery, not even for distant Sweden!
Visited all beauty for the first time and found my product immediately. Nice price and a very quick delivery will make me by again :-)
Here you will find everything at a lower price and fast delivery.
I've been shopping a great deal at CJ's lately. They never fail to deliver. Now, of course with the release of Battlefield 4, I was expecting that it might be slightly delayed considering the insane amount of orders - but no. I got my key the second after I paid, and the price was almost half of what Origin take. CJ's make my gaming life amazingly much easier - and I would recommend them to ANYONE - ALWAYS.
The headline says it all. I easily give amazon.co.uk five well deserved stars for their price, product range and foremost shipping times!
Good quality prints and merchandise with good selection of motives. Quite fast delivery from UK to Sweden. Very good customer support, some minor issues with the order was efficently resolved. Recommended!
Good price, decent american car at one of the big companys (Alamo). No hassle with the car or the rental. The lady at desk was quite surly when she tried to sell us even more insurance (which we didn't need), but Rentalcars can hardly be blamed for that. Would consider renting via them again.
Good price and one of the few options for the hotel we wanted. No problems at all with the booking or stay. Somewhat anoying that we had to pay in advance and print a voucher, although I got several mails reminding me to bring the voucher, a nice feature.
I have bought a few games on CJS and almost every time it went smooth. I payed and I received my product but now It has almost gone a week and still I haven't received a valid key. When I bought the game it was In Stock and it still is. I tried several times to contact you on facebook and your support system but you haven't replied. I see you replying to everyone else except me and that is really mean done to a true customer like me. -------- EDIT -------------------------- After a week CJS finally contacted me and gave me a valid CD KEY. From the moment they contacted me they worked very fast and I'm pleased with that.
Bought football boots that ripped after 2-3 weeks. Sent them an email and they exchanged them very fast. Not much whining as the most companies would do. Have bought 10 other pair of boots there since. Only downside. I live in sweden and I find the delivery price expensive compared to other companies.
Bought new football boots and they broke after 2 months. Used them regularly and treated them good. Asked for a refund/exchange using their E-mail contact form online and it took them 20 days to reply something completely useless. After a month of speaking with them they just started to ignore my emails. They don't reply and seem not to care.
I have had the pleasure to use this company a few times over the last few years, and I always had the best service I ever had experience in any car rental company, it there any problem then they solve this to my problems fast and without any question ask. I highly recommend this company. They also have the best deals in Romania
I have purchased twice, been in contact with customer service once and all I can say is very good service and very proffessional. I will definitly be shopping here more.
HMA is great and their customer service is always helpful if anything would happened!
Bought two restrung squash rackets. Very fast delivery and the rackets was just what I wanted.
No hazle, just straightforward and very fast delivery. I will shop there again.
Oneplay is one of the best online gamestores out there. I bought a few games from them and they never let me down. I recommend Oneplay to all my gamer friends.
I placed my order and everything was packed and shipped according to their terms and conditions. Can warmly recommend these guys as knowledgeable, helpful and, of course, professional.
Dont expect courtesy or confortness. It will get you there for a cheap amount
It has been more than 8 days and my order hasnt been shipped, I called on wednesday, thursday and friday and every day they said that it would ship that same day. If they dont have it in inventory, say so so for those who expect it to have soon will not make the purchase. Oh they did charge me right away. They are fast in that.
Ordered snow boots for my son from Ecco, as we were so happy with our first purchase. Delivery was quick and the boots are perfect, my son loves them!
Delivers affordable items to full satisfaction and if not, fixes it happily.
I had one watch with drained battery and one that had a broken glass. Instead of going to an expensive watch maker i ordered a watch opener for 99 SEK inkl delivery. It worked fine and my watches is running great now and i saved a lot of money.
Many orders made. A couple of problems got solved quickly and to my satisfaction. Chattsupport is great!
No products shipped, No money back, they refuse to answer your emails and letters. Please do not waste your money here because Toolshack will keep them. I have contacted a Consumer network called ECC-Net, but Toolshack won't even talk to them, as far as I know. I guess my money is gone forever? This is an embarrassing and heartless company. UPDATE! The problem is now solved and my money has been refunded, at last.
Said it would be delivered the day after I ordered, was for my husbands birthday.  But did not come that day!  I also got no notification about when it actually was delivered, and since my husband went away the following day after it should have been received I don't know when it actually was delivered. However, the flowers were very nice and the ordering process itself was easy.
Unfortunately one of the lenses I ordered was wrong, and I was first told they hade the correct one but in a different prescription, and then the day after I was told they did not have it at all. Because of this I chose to return the lenses I had been sent, and to get a refund. However, the refund did not cover the £ 5,50 that it cost me to return the lenses to the UK. I was told  I would not have to pay for returning the lenses if I sent them to their freepost-address, but that only works in the UK. So Lenstores mistake cost me £ 5,50, which I am only giving them one star.
I have been looking for some special pens here in Sweden for a quite while now. I have tried to find theese pens as well online in Sweden. In one book store they suggested me to order the pencils from abroad, and from this shop Cult Pens. So I tried that out and I do not regret that at all. Quick service and a couple of days later I had what I have been ordering and what I have paid for. Low nice price both on the pencils and the shiping from the UK to Sweden! And I also started to smile for the small extras in the package, nice touch to the whole service. Thank you so very mutch for this!
I love the price on bare minerals, but still havn't recived The order even though it was made 2 weeks ago
We are very satisfied with the service ShopUSA did for us and we will use the site again.
Very easy and practical. Special thanks to the online service and the help on site of Thrifty customer support when picking up the car in Dubai.
My only reservation is the use of DHL , a notoriously bad company (just search the net !) with some lame excuses , when delivery took four extra days on the last leg ... and not my first experience with them ! LtC
Me and my girlfriend are happy we traveled with saigon2muine after a really long flight which was delayed. Without any hassle the driver waited outside the airport with our sign taking us to his car. We were about 2 hours late so the driver must have been waiting for a while. The car was spacious and comfortable and the driver was friendly and drove us safely to our destination in Mui Ne. It took about 4,5h with a lunch break. we can really recommend this service and we would without a doubt travel with them again!
At Bologna Airport in december 2013 I had booked and paid rental cost in advanced. Before I should get the keys I was asked to pay an insurance I already paid and further costs sky high. I newer ever in my life will use your service or recommend anybody.
Hi I found Whybuynew, by accident on line and saw that they had the Mackie Thump 15 active speakers that i have been looking for in Sweden to buy at a good price! They had a pair in b stock for a bargin price, but i thught the delivery would be a downer.... But the delivery kost was only 6.95 to Sweden! home to my front door, and  fast!!! The speakers was also in perfekt condition,as good as new. I can recomend this company to anyone who wants to buy sound ,and light gears as the prices are absolutey very good I will come back and buy more stuff from you!!!! Thanx for the Thumps. Anders "Party Dj"
Every time I have ordered from Country Attire, the items fully correspond to the descriptions and images on the web site. The delivery is always very quick and smooth! Thank you for a great site!
Its a nice way to share your photos, make it public or just friends. The interface isn't the best i have seen and it take sometime before you are used to it. Pretty cheap. But i miss the opportunity to see a bigger pics, it could fill more of the screen. But i can recommend it and i have. No commercials ( you pay not to see it) and it´s a plus. Verdict....try it, you can love it or not, but it´s not expensive so it´s worth a try.
I ordered a jacket that was too small, sent it back and the money was in the bank two days later - this is the quickest I have experienced any company to refund.
This must be the worst experience ever in our about 10 years of ordering products on internet!! We ordered over 40 days ago and still no package and hardly NO response from them after writing about 10 e-mails and chatting with one of the staff!! They only response we got was that someone told us that the package should be at our local postoffice, but there is no proof or sign of that cos we don´t have any parcel or tracking number!! Why don´t we get any answers from you about this matter??? This is rude or simply som kind of scam or fraud!! What kind of company do you really run?? We want our money back or our products right away!!! Get back to us ASAP!!! Robert & Olga from Sweden
This company is also one of the best online companies we have ever dealt with and their prices and trustworthy is always top notch!!:-)
We have ordered products many times from Wiggle and they always deliver without any hassle!! Very trustworthy and with superb products and prices!! Highly recommended!! Regards, Robert from Sweden
I have used eFlorist to send flowers to my daughter several times during the last couple of years. Each time the flowers have been good quality, nicely presented and delivered as promised. Great!
Everything is absolutely great, but the fact that cc purchase is not available from out of the UK.
You sooo need to go and check out this site for a cool cult product! The only reason why I haven't tried every single product on the site is cause I'm a student, but if I could I would! The shipping fees are really resonable and the shipping time is awsome, like I live in Sweden and it came to me litterally within three days! Check it out guyes!
Will defiantly shop at countryattire again in the future. Great prices, quick delivery and the service is awesome :). Also recieved a free scarf with my jacket as a gift.
I ordered a part to sweden, I got the package well packaged and everything but the only downside was that the shipping was over 50% of the price of the goods.
I can't believe so many negative opinions. It must be because those who are pleased actually hardly ever write reviews. Myself I find Matches the best and most trustworthy clothing retailer on the net. I've been shopping there for 2 years - never ANY ptoblems. Neither with the products, nor with refunds. Great and always helpful customer service. Free returns would render Matches a shopping paradise, but I actually hardly ever send anything back when I shop from them (happened maybe twice).
I found the old-fashioned Moulin Roty and the three stove-top pots which I've been looking all over for and waiting to buy since I first saw them three years ago in France. It was easy to choose the products, get the shipping cost and fill in my details. I tried to register from the beginning and the website didn't register the details.  I needed to register separately a few days later. The e-mail with the delivery details had a link to a delivery company website which was not the one being used for my shipment and I was not able to track the shipment which was a little frustrating. I am still waiting for an answer from my e-mail regarding the registration and getting my points applied to my account.  Hopefully customer service will answer soon!
I live in Sweden and have places orders from country attire several times, always with a satisfactory result. /Michaela
*update 31th may, getthelabel have refunded me without hassle and they even paid the return even though i had to fight for it as it was my right, actually it was the kind staff on Facebook that took care of it.  Their email support was ignoring my request based on consumers rights they even failed to understand my message by purpose i guess , like its their training. I also bought a penguin t shirt which was a good t shirt and I'm happy with it. So I might purchase again from getthelabel but the brand ralph lauren not, never.  So I'm upgrading it to 2 stars. If i had only bought the penguin t shirt I would have given them 4 stars. *update RL stor sweden says by pictures it looks fake but tag looks very good. GTL FB:We’re more than happy to facilitate a return if you inbox us your details. Really sorry to hear you’re disappointed with the product, be assured it is genuine Ralph Lauren sourced through our European supplier, that’s the reason you will not be able to compare it with a UK like product. Please inbox us to arrange a return at no cost to you Many thanks, Charlotte@GTL ----------------------------------- MY MSG: So if i would compare it with european item it will be the same and comparable? GTL FACEBOOK That’s right, if you were to compare it with the exact same item bought in Europe, you will see that it is genuine. 1 I live in sweden 2 i thought uk was europe 3 it has chinese labels.  so how can i ever compare it to an european model? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prior purchace i could not find anything bad when googling get the label ( as sportsdirect sold me bad items im suspect towards uk) Now i see lots,  I bought a RL zipup sweatshirt. When I received it I could clearly see something was not right, The tags does not look good, the plastic bag sticker does not say anything about ralph lauren as other genuine items do and get the label has put another sticker on top of it. the logo had a lose stitching at the stick-head and the tags and plastic box it came in does not look like any other RL item i have ,the logo showing sizes says L 180/100 never seen anything except s,m,l, xl and so on. When I went to youtube I saw someone showing a chinese fake and that is how this polos shaft looks like at the logo. And lose threads should not be on the chest logo. Open a ticket at paypal stating it is fake if everyone does so get the label cant continue selling fake, wonder why so many negative feedback came recently, probably people did not know better but thanks to internet they can realize they been whistled. Im not 100% its fake but all the circumstances with the plastic bag and tags makes me almost 100.
I ordered iphone5 unlock (Telenor - Sweden) in August to get in queue by paying GBP 19.99. Further asked to pay rest by telling that Unlock is available now and I paid GBP 45. Nothing happened for next 3-4 weeks. No change in status order status either. Was showing "Supplier holidays" all the time. I repeatedly wrote in support column asking for clarification, never get any response. I dialed UK support phone number and i just got irritating response that "Unlock server is Down". They recommend me to wait for couple of weeks. I waited and then again wrote on support column on 12 nov. After that they appololize and told that now its submitted to unlock server, it will be unlocked in 3 days. I thought, now it work as status changed to "IMEI submitted to unlock server". I waited again for 1 week and wrote in support requesting status on 19-Nov. No one responded. I again dialed in UK support phone number. Same irritating response (without the explanation that if server was down why the hell you will submit my order to unlock server). I again wrote to support page and to their sales AND no response yet again.  I am having Worst experience with these guys,
I have been a member for over a year click on my mails visit site and free stuff simple!
Unibet processed my card from their servers in even though I didn't sign up for an account.  When they realized their mistake they refunded some of the money, but not all of it.  They then told me I will have to report this to the police as fraud, even though no person, just the Unibet bots, processed my card. I had to cancel all my cards and report it to the police.  The customer service was extremely rude, but I suppose that is to be expected from the people who rob you.
I ordered a pair of bifocals for a recipe on the town from an optician. With a huge variety, it was easy to select eyeglass frames. The dimensions are important. Then I chose the glass very easily. It is only to highlight the selection.
This company is not a serious business. Its Fraud company that have no idea what they are doing. My order was cancelled and was promised a refund. No refund and dispatch of package anyway with a really bad packaging. The result a damaged item. (Which i fixed my self and had to cover the cost my self. Very hard to get any responses from this company. Så please do not order anything from here. You will be dissapointed and i am so angry that i didnt read the reviews my self before i ordered.
This is an updated review. And therefor the answear is dated. This is posted on Dec 11. Had problems with 3 out of 4 orders in the past, but decided to try again after being given a 15% discount because of the previous problems (not much compared to other companies). So placed a new order on Sunday Dec 1. Recieved an order confirmation and then - nothing! Expected dispatch email on Monday -nothing! On Thursday I had sent 3(!) emails to find out when my order would be dispatched, and again - NOTHING!!!  On Friday I finally got an answear, that it was being dispatched that day. Today dec 11 I recieved my order. One of the items I ordered was a Christmas present for a friend who left the country YESTERDAY and for whom I had to buy another gift as a replacement for the jacket that didn't arrive in time! If this is customer care and compensation for previous problems then I could totally do without it! And YES, I am dissapointed AGAIN!!!
I found this website while searching for bareMinerals products and now I purchase almost all my make up and hair styling products from BeautyBay.com. It's easy, it's cheap and always fast deliveries!! I live in Sweden and I love that I can see the prices in my own currency and not once has it failed!!! I sure recommend this!!
Userfriendly web site with all you might need for Mx on all levels. Competitive shipping rates on EU shipping has made Dirtebikebitz my main supplier.
Excellent service and fast delivery. The Fastway driver was very helpful as I wasn't home at the time and he came to my work, please pass this on, thank you.
Ordered a few items to be shipped to Sweden.  Everything arrived as expected and was well wrapped and undamaged.
An incredibly structured and planned course, that requires time and patience. The course goes through an awful lot. Suitable for beginners but also those who also photographed a while and need insperation. I highly recommend this course! There are also a lot of extra material to take note of. thumbs up (Y) Really good that you had plenty of time to cope with the course! If not, the time had stretched as far as it did, I would never have been finished with the course but was finished :) satisfied and happy girl! :)
I ordered two different models of shoes in size UK14 and received the first pair after less than a week (to Sweden). After trying them out I decided to cancel the order of the second pair of shoes, since they were sent on special order to the manufacturer and had delivery time of 2-4 weeks, and there were no problem at all to cancel it! Sure, some people would be bathered by missing out on the £5 discount voucher I used but on the other hand, it would cost me £3-£4 to return the second pair of shoes anyway so it didn't matter to me in this case.
I've ordered many times from Magic Madhouse. Every time the order shows up super fast in my mailbox. The assortment of accessories and single cards are just amazing. For me who lives in Sweden there are no local stores that compare at all.
I was unsure of buing my wedding dress online, so I registered and used paypal and it went great! Higly rekomend it to people.
Excellent service with quich delivery, i will recommend you to others.
Just a very good site. Easy overview, great functionality and information. I find myself being happily surprised that the connectivity between different parts of the site is so intuitive and, for a lack of better description, working. That's not even mentioning the impressive  range of products, the prices or the shipping. With the risk of sounding over-enthusiastic wiggle works just like you want  a online shop to work. Great job!
Nice service. It makes it easier and faster to find the right choice, than if I had to sit and browse for hours, in order to find the movers that is right for me.
It was easy to order, easy to follow and I received the package within a few days even though I'm in Sweden. Very happy with the product and will recommend Country Attire to all my friends.
A lite overpriced but the service is great and everything came nicely packaged
My order got canceled 2 times, the wrong item was sent and no answer from the support in several months about the wrong item
Ordered a neoprene vest the 14th. Mailed them about two hours later to add a weight belt to the order, but they replied (fast) that it was not possible since the order had been dispatched. The order dispatch e-mail was not received until the 16th though. A bit strange... DHL did a fine job however, my parcel was sent through all of Europe in 1 business day.
No problems what so ever. However, if you need to contact bravofly, it seems the only option is to call an expensive number in the UK. This is really crappy, not being able to communicate by e-mail is really a setback. In my case no contact was needed though.
I placed an order and was by the order confirmation informed that all items were in stock. Several calls and e-mails later I cancelled the order after waiting over a month. After been waiting for two weeks without any information at all I called the service desk and was informed the one of the items were out of stock and that the order would be shipped the week after. Friday the next week (no information received) I called again and asked them to send the order in two separate parcels since it was still not shipped. Got an ok. The next week, still not shipped, another call, another promise to ship the goods the same day. Next day, still not shipped, another promise to ship one parcel at the latest noon the next day. Two days later, still not shipped, no information. Another call to service desk. Now I get the information that ANOTHER item in my order is now out of stock, why they still haven't shipped anything. I cancelled the order after waiting over a month. Babyhuys must improve their inventory system, information to customers and raise their service level. Ordered from another webshop and everything was delivered 4 days later.
Dear best friend of mine, I can't find one reason whatsoever,  why you shouldn't buy all your books by AwesomeBooks!
After ordering i got a mail that some of the products was not in the stock, so price for sending the rest, was after that, very heigh 30 Pund, in Amazon or Ebay the price i normally 4,5. And you always get what you order.
If i need something els to me or my bike,this is the shop 4 mee. The Swede
I will NEVER order from CDON.se again. They say on the website it will take only 1-3 working days!!! I order a D-Link 5222l on Friday around 12:00 and now it's Tuesday and when looking status it the same it was yesterday. Then I contact CDON.se by chat and they just say sorry it will be sent today or tomorrow. Tomorrow are you stupit. DON'T ORDER FROM CDON.se and belief that it only will take 1-3 days ;-(
very carefully selected products with great quality. best herbshop i have come across in europe so far. they provide a broad spectrum of quality brands in my opinion.
I love the things I ordered from Ikrush! It took less than a week for the package to arrive to Sweden.Will absolutely order again!! I am very happy I found their site.
This was obviously the right way to find what I wanted and get the right price. The only problem is that there is little description on the complicated ferry harbours and how to get there, The ships are also described rather sparse but I suppose that has to do with not very much research.
Have been ordering from BB several times with no greater problems, the delivery time (live in sweden) has also been ok. But then my second last order ago, the order never came. I can understand that it's process regarding missing orders of waiting 20 work days. But what I don't understand is that after I emailed in the signed form for missing order (did it the same day I received it by email from BB) no word! Not a single word despite several reminding email from my part in over three weeks after i sent the signed form. Since the company already charged me for the items, I was starting to get quit desperate and started to wonder if BB was stealing from me... like I said, several reminding email and not a single word. Just one mail that said, "we see your query and we havn't forgotten you, but unfortunately we need some more time" would have been enough, then I would at least have known that BB was there and got my query. But no word! Not until I posted an angry message on their facebook wall for other to see,I got an responce ( and do I need to say, that the comment was put down from the wall really fast too). Because of the extremly porly handeling at least I thought (I asked for it) as compensation for the new replacement order to be sent by express. This so I wouldn't have to wait but most importantly, wouldn't have to risk that the order wouldn't turn up again... but not even a comment regarding my claim for compensation. Did'nt realy feel like I got an appology for the incident at al either. That thing go wrong with the delivery that is outside BB's control I can accept and understand. But I can not understand or accept the extremly poor handeling and non existing customer service from BB when things do go wrong. I have made an order after this experience, but I honestly belive that was my last one. With their bad customer service they have managed to loose an prior realy satisfied customer, to one that now warns others to shop from them.
I have order a Ray Ban RB3025 and paid by my credit card 3 days ago, I also provide my address declaration from skattverket as they required (very strange requirement) 2 days ago. I have e-mailed them four times yesterday and today without any reply. It obvious more than 24 hours. You can't find any telephone number of this company, and the customer service seems not exist!!! I don't know what happened to my order, after check others reviews from the internet, now I am very worried about my order. I m going to cancel my order if I still don't get any reply, worry about whether I can get back of my money! I have do internet shopping in Sweden for several times, this is my first time with this situation.Very disappointed and frustrated for this website.
This is an awesome service. They have really every tv show you can think of, a bit thinner supply of movies though. But to be able to choose any tv show and look at almost any episode of it instantly is really great. And this for 7$ a month! That's the price to rent two movies normally, but with Netflix you have unlimited numbers of rentals for this price. They have also got a really good iPad app. Highly recommended!
A really good vendor in eu, with very cheap shipping (15€ to Sweden) and superb service. I am a returning costumer and in those few cases something been wrong, they have been very serviceable.
Nice and interesting products with very good information pages on herbs and their usage. Fast and cheap shipping inside Europe.
Order many games from spelbutiken and love it every time !
Vivamondo is the most complete online (or offline ) store I have experienced this far (and I have seen some). They have about every brand I know of and plenty more. The prices are overall good (some of the fragrances can be found elsewhere at even better prices). I have bought some skin care products from Dr Dennis Gross and Laura Mercier and am very satisfied. I have also been in touch with the customer care of Vivamondo and got answers within a couple of hours. Will be back!
I was promised two weeks delivery and got my things without any problems. My order was nicely and safely packed in a large box.
My parcel arrived a few days after placing the order, which is great! I had questions regarding picking up my parcel, and the questions were answered very quickly by the customer service, and I appreciate that!
The support team is excellent, friendly and quick to reply. However it takes a long time to get the things delivered, even if they are in stock. I recommend not to use the free delivery, it can take as long as 2 weeks.... and no status information on the homepage. Would I buy from Wiggle again? Yes, but only if the price is good with the more expensive delivery option included.
Pefect fit and a perfect deliverytime. Best site ever that I have ordered from. I will recomend it to my friends.
The jacket is just as I expected it from the presentation online. I'm very happy with this purchase!
Thanks so much for good quality, good service and fast delivery.
Bought a detox shampoo to be sent to Sweden, but took 7 rather than 5 workdays, as promised by the website Another remark was their overuse of those foam pieces that are supposed to make sure the product doesn't get hurt, which was totally unnecessary for my product, and just bad for the environment Generally I can't say if they are very good or bad, but my experience with them was allright and their prices are usually quite good!
Watersports Warehouse is not just fast in shipping your order, that have a real high quality customer service too. They patiently answers all your questions and are flexible and very service minded. If all web-shops were like this I would buy everything on the internet
Well I can't say anything bad. I ordered my e-cig last sunday and got it at wednessday, I think it's amazing since I live in Sweden.
May review was removed due to wrong order number. My ordernumber at Infurn is AU-127201. Please check I did order six Y-chairs, a lamp and a clock back in April 2012. And yes, I did know that there was long delivery terms. I initially got informed they were to be delivered in August. The delivery dates was then pushed to December ("did not pass their quality check" seen that a couple of times in other reviews) and then to March. About that time I had read all the negative reviews on Trustpilot and started to understand that my money was at risk here. - After the stated 34 weeks I did ask for a refund in February 13th. - At March 20th I did get in contact with them once again and got told "we will send a reminder to Finance department". Nothing happened. - Contact again at April 29th and got told "we have had reorganizations at Finance, please wait one 2-3 weeks" - Another contact at May 25th I once again received their standard answer "we have had reorganizations at Finance please wait 2-3 weeks" By now you all know that nothing have happened. I have not received my money, nor update. Next step is the police. Please do stay as far away from this company as you can. The do not deliver anything, Update June 24th 2013: After posting the review here at Trustpilot things started moving. Soon after I entered the review I was contacted by Infurn. Now I do now have received my money back. All-in-all a really bad experiance but I am very happy that the use of Trustpilot did result in the best possible way....to have my money returned. Big thanks for that. I am hesitant in changing my rating of this company to two stars. I do a alot of web purchases every year, and this is my worst experience by far.
This place is a total waste of time. I made two orders from two different supplier, the first supplier wanted me to pay outside (which is against the rules of Aliexpress) which of course I didn't. The second supplier was disabled due to fraudulent activies and of course... the tracking number given was fake or ended up elsewhere. If you love rubbing your face in trouble and problems, wasting your time dealing with scammers - this is the place I recommend strongly (sarcasm!)
I've been with Thehousthouse.co.uk for a while and I got nothing but good things to say about them. Jonathan does his best to accomodate you and give you a supreme service. If you're looking for a place to host your websites, this is your spot.
I purchased a copy of Battlefield 3 for a friend via Gaming-keys.com, the delivery was nearly instant. Apparently there was a problem with the email address that I gave, so the staff let me know they tried to send me the scanned key without success. I contacted them back telling them that they could send it to a next email, which they did. To me this is excellent service. I put them in my favourites.
I purchased a scanned cd key of Activisions hyped up game, the latest instalment of the Call Of Duty franchise. Never seen such dedication from the staff to give their customers support when it comes to getting the game language correctly. I do recommend Direct2Play and I shall return.
If you are looking great staff and want your order to be taken care of almost immediately? This is your spot.
I stumbled upon Caseking when looking for new DDR3 sticks.  Blindly I made an order on a late Sunday evening, received the goods the coming Friday afternoon. Yes, I do recommend Caseking.de
I bought a key to Homefront for PC from Elitekeys and within 20 minutes I had the serial sent to my email ready to activate on Steam without no issues nor problems whatsoever. I do recommend Elitekeys.
I've spotted an USB audio interface that I wanted for a time and ordered it. Without any previous experience with Inta-Audio.com I never expected my order to be taken care of the same day and even dispatched hours later. I am giving Inta-audio.com a 5 star and I will definitely purchase from them again. Yes, I do recommend this site.
Very good custom service. Super fast and I would recommend this company to all who want cheap and yet designer glasses.
Everything went smooth and without problems. Five star if I was notified when the item was dispatched.
The entire process was exemplary - from price quote to final product took just a couple days.  I'm extremely happy with the translation and service.
This company really gives you value for the money and delivers your goods incredibly fast. I've done  purchases for some of my clients by now and have no reason to hesitate to buy more from them!
Great assortment of clothing and at a really good price. The quality isn't brilliant but will definitely last you a season. Little annoyed at the Euro price being more than the GBP price, but those that I contacted were really helpful and apologetic. Great idea to have free delivery over a certain amout  as that definitely decides on whether I buy or not as I live in Sweden. You should definitely give this site a go if you haven't before!
This was the place with the absolute best price for the Carhartt blazer. The item is great as well as both the price for it and the delivery. But I have ordered things from India that have arrived in two days on two different occasions which makes the delivery time from England quite embarrassing. It has been easter, I am aware of that,  but still... Still I am satisfied with the purchase and will return and give Menlook another chance if the price is equally competitive.
I want tracking information for my order and an estimaten delivery time from the beginning
We ordered a bunch of t-shirts with various motives and the names of our kids and were very pleasantly surprised, both by the very good quality and softness of the fabric and the excellent artwork (images and text). We have no hesitation recommending Simply Colours!
Beware of their online doctor service! They took my money and gave absolutely nothing I return.
I have received only few contact via this site. But it is a good start.
After reading reviews here at trustpilot and some other websites I got a bit worried. But my jeans showed up as promised. It took 1 week from order to shipment, and 1 more week till it showed up at the door. From the order confirmation it was far from clear it would take this long. I could follow the shipment through the DPD tracking, got a tracking number from customer support. The mail tracking process was not state of the art though, compared to a bunch of other webshops where one is used to get mail alla along the chain, in this case the follow-up was not so tight. But hey, I have a pair of new 506 :-)
Good quality products, customer friendly price and good selection of goods.
I am impressed by the web page, it's easy to find your way around. I feel professionally and well treated. The supply is good. However, after placing my order I was told my shoes where not on stock and I would have to wait 3-4 weeks for them, although it said on the web page that all shoes in regular fitting and with the regular heel where in stock. I was disappointed about this. I was also disappointed at not getting more help with choosing the right size of shoe. I measured my foot and asked for advice on which shoe size to pick, but was only refered to the size converting chart on the web page, which of course I had already found by myself.
I have placed several orders before this one and never had any problems.  Great prices, service and delivery!
The site and company i was liked. very good variety of good pedagogic toys and good prices. I will for sure recommend this site to my friends, relatives and will proceed for  myself to buy their some toys. good luck with Your business
Website was simple to use, shipping prompt and costs appear competitive.
I am very sorry because my order was sent on 9 /8 but I don´t receive that yet. I contacted customs service.
Order to Sweden arrived in 4 days. Very impressed with the handling of my order and the Barbour jacket was as good as i expected. Martin
I live in Sweden and I am very impressed with the free shipping and how fast the machine was delivered. It´s very nice to recieve extra Equipment like needles, scissors and so on. I´m very contempt and would gladly order my next sewing machine from SMD.
This is a webpage who claims that you will be able to download various open-source source-code. In reality, you can not download anything unless you pay, and this is something they will not tell you untill after you have signed up. Do not ever give your real e-mail to this webpage.
I do not from where they have stolen my contact-information, but just the fact that they have stolen it and use it for sending spam means that this is an unserious spamer.
It seems like the main purpose of this site is to supply spamers with a tool for spreading their shit.
This company send spam to me even though i have never bought anything from them and i have never ever accepted any form of spam from any company. Also, they do not tell where they have bought/stolen my contact information. A serious company would not act like that.
I used this webpage to make a reservation five years ago. After receiving some spam from them i requested that they should delete my personal data and they promised to do so. About a year later the spam continued. This time i called them and asked how they can spam me when they had promised my personal data was deleted. They claimed it had been a "misunderstanding" because when they wrote that they had "deleted all personal data", they meant "made a one year pause in the newsletter subscription". But after that they promised that this time my data was permanently deleted. Now five years later they start to send me spam again. In other words they are lying straight into my face over and over again.

This company sends spams and handles my personal information without my approval. You should never ever give any personal information, or credit-card, or any money to a company that does not respect even the most basic rules for marketing and handling personal data.
This is not a serious company. This is a spamer. Avoid this company and avoid giving them any personal information such as e-mail addresses.
They send spam to me without my approval and without any information about from who they have bought my personal data. That is not how a serious company act.
I had a very unpleasant stay at "Best Western Premier Dua Sentral", in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. When i complained four times over a period of a day and they still did not even try to solve my issue i wrote down the story as a review on some hotel-review sites. Now it seems like Best Western are paying sites lite tripadvisor for removing unwanted reviews. That is not very nice behavior from a hotel chain who claims to care about the customer.
I have written several reviews about bad hotels but they disappear without any explanation. They are not denied or anything, they just disappear without notifying me. I have tried to get an explanation from tripadvisor but they do not respond. I assume tripadvisor get paid by the hotels to remove unwanted reviews.
The item I ordered was fully to my satisfaction. The quality and price where great!
I made an order of 6 Verner Panton chair the 7th of July 2013. I dod not realise that there was a 10-12 week delivery time. Anyway i waited and I waited and I checked my delivery time and until today there is absolutely no delivery done. The most interesting thing is that on my order page it say that two chairs are on its way. Its been like this for almost one month. It say Your order 0009900002L1775240 has been received in our warehouse and its shipping documents are now being registered. For detailed information on its shipping, please visit this site again 24 hours later. I visited the page over and over again and it just inform me that two chairs are in the warehouse and will be delivered. The funny thing nothing is happening. Its been like this for almost a month now. I have already bought other chairs and I expect INFURN as a serious company will return my money SEK 5.624 to my VISA card. If they will not return the money I must contact my lawyers in Spain and ask them to act against INFURN and make them bankrupt. I am hopeful however that they honour their commitment in their website. INFURN write this in their terms ---  If we fail to handover the promised high quality item to the shipping carrier after the second post-production, you have the right to cancel the order by the end of the 34th week from the day of your initial purchase. ---- I made the order the 7th of July 2013 and now its the 27th of April so its more than 34 weeks after the order was placed. The funny thing is that the terms give me the right to cancel my order but will they return my money. To finish this review, I strongly recommend you not to buy from INFURN no matter what they promise. The delivery may not take place or you may risk your payment. There is other suppliers that can ship the goods you like. All the best Mikael from Sweden
Hi! I just wanted to say that your products and delivery times are the best ! Everytime! This is the best shop for nutrition . Just really wanted to say that and this is the first time i write to a company and giving them compliments. But you guys are worth it! Keep it up! Micael Dillner (one happy customer)
good and fast service, even for me who livs in Sweden
Do something more efficient, I had to uninstall it cause it's just weird!
This is the best information thing alingading about movies. I get all my information about TV-shows and movies from here! Thanks!
This is by far the best search engine out there! Thanks, Google helps me alot.
CJs was slow took over 24hrs and I wanted my game ASAP as the Autokey system promised, and it also said that it was in stock, but hell I don't really care. For that price I could wait 3 days or more! Thanks CJ!
very good contact  , fast shipping , really recommended !
Bought a cycling jacket from cyclestore. 40% off the retail price in Sweden and including free delivery. It took a couple weeks for it to arrive (8 days after it was shipped) but that was fine with me. Happy and returning customer!
I got perfect service from the sales department, quick replies to my questions and help to pick out a few diamonds matching the criteria set by me. Delivered on time as promised and the ring looks absolutely fantastic. Thank you DiamondGeezer!
This product came to me as described in the website... And yes anybody should order less one size of the original size.... Love spartoo & love their services :-) Cheers Khader
I love Jack and Jones products, they are always with very awesome quality... the service as well as delivery is really great and always comes on time with good notification process via SMS. I would really recommend more positive attitude from J&J by offering free gifts for people ordering 500 kr and above.
Somehow, for some reason they changed my postcode, so here I am, 10 days after expected delivery still waiting for my package. Company I ordered from has my correct postcode (the one I entered) and I had to call the Swedish postal service myself to try and straighten things out. Hopefully I'll get my stuff before I go abroad on holiday, if ever. There is still no explanation as to how my postcode was randomly changed to a faulty one.
I just love yesstyle, it's one of the best sites to order clothing and it's usually just as cheap as ebay or other sites but with better support and delivery options. Free Express shipping on $99 orders is awesome and means that I can get another item instead of paying for shipping. I also love the Elite club system, it really makes it feel like you get something back for being a long time customer. They also have so many brands to choose from and different styles. They have good descriptions and size guides on most clothes which is a huge plus for me as I otherwise have a hard time finding the right size. I have recommended Yesstyle to everyone I know
Its so awesome i got my game so quick no problem this place is a must if you like your games :D
I have ordered goods from them twice and both times I have been quickly and efficiently dispatched, and I am very pleased with Pharmacy 2 U.
I have ordered goods from them several times and all the times I have been quickly and efficiently dispatched, and I'm very happy with Chemist Direct. They have good selection out of medications that I need and the fact that they do not just send out medicine without questions
I ordered a desk organizer from Nomess Copenhagen and got an identical copy from another Finish brand, a product they didn't even have on the website or a product they have in their selection. I have no idea what happened and I've spoken to customer support and they told me it was an honest mistake. I still think it's a bit suspect when it says on the packing list they've packed a Nomess Copenhagen and they send me a copy. I was able to return it and I'm now waiting for me real product to arrive. I think the webshop should compensate me in some way when it's an effort for me to send it back... I'm not going to shop from this webshop again.
Amazing service, wow. super fast delivery. I made to 3 different orders, all of them came really fast, one of them i made the order Monday around 14.00 i had the package wednesday! This i certainly not the last time i order fom your site! BIG thumbs up from me!
This was the worst thing ever! i made an order in may, the i sendt an E-mail to see how far my order was! the sunglasses was no even in  stock, even though it said so on the webpage, i got no info at all, i had to contact them every day, and i never got though on the phone, but sometimes they answered on my mails. And in august i got my money back! cause they could not deliver my order, so it took 4 month to find out that they could not deliver. NO answer in the costumer service, at all! it was from the Danish webpage.
One of the few webshops that, most of the time, have all parts in stock when needed.
Ordered a pair of Sealskinz socks, mid weight knee lenght. Merlin was the only online shop that had these in stock. Very fast delivery!
It was very easy to find what I was looking for. The price was right, and the the delivery was very quick! I am very satisfied.
I did only one purchase on superdry.com and in general I'm very pleased with the service end delivery time.
It's amazing how cheap all dresses are. I live in Sweden and variety of dresses is very limited here. Boohoo online shop treat orders very fast and so is delivery. I am very pleased shopping at Boohoo.
Order processing was super fast, shipment was only a day or two and they even thought of making a small correction to my order so I got the right version of the machine (The one that's adapted to European use. They even added a converter so I could use it here in Sweden). I'm thankful they did that, otherwise I would have been been stuck with a machine that I couldn't use. Great!
Half the price compared to stores in Sweden and great with new products that are not yet launched here.
Perfect service, from ordering to I had the item in my hand in Sweden 2 days!!!!
I love Yesstyle because they have so many different brands to choose from. The prices are resonable and when you become an Elite Club Bronze Member you get 3% of everything, which is always something ^^ The only downside is that some items take much longer to be shipped, so those items I usually stay away from. Ida
A fine website together with an amazing customer support and extremely fast delievery service. I'm very impressed with you Guys! Kind regards, Martin - Swedish customer.
So easy and fast, had the game downloading from Origin within ten mins after the purchase. Price is low aswell.
Very easy to order, fast delivery and very low price compared to local shops / tax-free shops.
Very cheap prices and they have always delivered keys on time. My favorite game key store so far!
Even though I made changes to my order, it took only 4 days to get home goods. It's what I call service, super happy :-)
Great prince but after I first ordered it I got the message that it was 2-3 weeks delivery time on the item. I was a little dissapointed then but in less then a week it was shipped and in the end I was a happy customer.
We made an order for a Baby Jogger City Select with 2nd seat, babycot and several other additions. Got a great price, and two rain covers for free. Everything was shipped on the day of the order with complete tracking information at TNT Post parcel service. Great service, nice and helpful customer rep.
Great program to work with and have been testing it for a while now, but wanna buy it so one can contribute to the owner. Just love it
Very fast delivery I am so pleased and will buy something soon again
Fast delivery to Sweden, well package , Very good prices. I'm very pleased with you and I will order from you again. I hope in the future you will have free delivery for loyal customers outside UK. Thanks!
Only place I can buy fermented cod liver oil AND skate liver oil, to reasonable price :)
very good service prompt especially delivering to Swedan a very happy costumer :)
I buy lens liquid from Chemist direct two times a year. Cost about 2/3 of cost in Sweden, despite transport Cost. The Delivery time is about 2 weeks and give no feed back.
See above + very good assortment and free delivery to sweden (thanks for that!) You can also custom your clubs (which I did last year)
I use to use this company for transfer in Turkey and I thought about using it in United Emirates, so we did! We were so satisfied and felt very safe! I will go on using Suntransfers when we are on holiday and need transfer... In Unites Emirates the cars were so clean and nice! In Turkey they are not always that clean... :-)
Easy to follow! I've started recently so I have only tried the cool shakes, very tasty! Fast delivery even though I live in Sweden. Mailed a question for the customer service and got an answer quickly, you guys are the best!
Very good range of products at affordable prices. My experience is limited to wetsuits and neoprene products where K.o.W.S. has been my family's supplier for several years. Free and quick shipping within Europe is also a reason why we usually are shopping at K.o.W.S. When we have had an occasional problem, they have been very service minded and solved the problem quickly. I would recommend King of Water Sports for wetsuit gear to anyone. /Anders
My feelings for the company went up and down. I purchased a watch for almost 50% off the original price so I was very excited. When I noticed the expensive international shipping I was still excited because I thought it would arrive even faster. Tracking the package only works for a few days until it stops moving in the US. ~3 weeks later it arrives with a slight rip on the package. I was VERY disappointed but then I saw the watch in perfect condition and I'm just glad that nothing happened to it.
Made a reservation through mail contact with Mallorca Farmhouses. No problems at all. Good feedback on every step through the booking and payment. Feels safe and reliable.
I have now ordered two times from beautybay.com this month - and I love the site! For me, living in Sweden, this site gives me almost half-price on the products I want (compared to a swedish store), and that is sooooo good for a poor student like me!
I can really recommend Country Attire. The prices are really good, I got an extra free gift ( a pair of Hunter socks worth almost £19). The delivery to Sweden was fast (4- days). I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend Country Attire to a friend
Everything was very accurate and easy to deal with your company. Time of delivery a little bit slower than I thought as it said delivery was in stock but I´m very satisfied with my deal with you.
I've bought sleeving and other stuff from Nils at MDPC-X twice now. Really great and personal service every time. The quality of the sleeving and screws is just amazing. Nothing else beats it :) If you want quality-sleeves for your computer-build, MDPC-X is the way to go ! Low shipping cost in Europe, and it only took 4 days for the package to travel from Germany to Sweden! Recommended!
Was looking around for a "PCI Express 16x flexible riser card" here in Sweden without luck. I stumbled across LinITX.com and found what I was looking for instantly! Once I confirmed the order it took only 3 hours for them to pack and ship it off to Europe. Less then 36 hours later I had it in my hand ! Really great experience! Recommended !
I´m satisfiad with my order and the respons from customer service, but i live in Sweden and it almost took 3 weeks so therefor they only get 4 stars, but i do recomend them :)
Do you want a spend a fortune on fragrances? Well, then Allbeauty is not the right online shop for you. They have very reasonable prices.
I bought a very nice suede jacket. There were no problems with ordering from Sweden. The jacket came after five days, so it was quickly delivered to me. Unfortunately, the jacket is too small and did not really know the sizes, I think, but otherwise all was bra.Jag will recommend my friends to shop with Muubaa.
Great service with fast reply by mail. We live in Sweden and our delivery only took five days!
All parts were cheap, turned up quickly and in good packaging.
I can highly recommend Jackan Skandinavian! The service vas really great and the delivery was fast.
I keep up at your website and whenever i shop it's quick, easy and a really good price.
My only reason for not giving the full 5 stars is that the website is not working properly. Every time you make a purchase or want to login for some other reason, you have got to make a new account, as it won't recognise  the email that is already registered. Also, if you use the webform to contact them it does not send it through even if it looks like it has. I guess it has to do with corrupt databases.
Correct parts were delivered in time, even though i expected express delivery to be even faster!  Will recommend part master to my friends.
It was Easy to find the correct part on the web page, the ordering process went smoothie and i could track the delivery! The correct parts were delivered in time to a good price compered to available alternatives
Took four days before a pair of shoes that was in stock was sent out. Kind of hard to understand. Given that everything comes from France this means it really takes ten days before you get what you order. Very slow.
Just a perfect dealer because it couldn't be more easy to find the items I was looking for, purchase them and get them delivered to my doorstep. Just really satisfied.
It was my first order at Filmudsalg and it was as one can hope for, quick email reponses, fast delivery even abroad and no hassle payment (credit card).
I bought several Makita cordless power tools from Toolstop. They have a great website showing price in your currency and automatic calculated freight cost to your country. When I had a few questions choosing the tools I got outstanding help while using their live chat function. I really recommend Toolstop for easy, fast and affordable shopping of professional power Tools and accessories. //Ralf from Sweden
I've been using Wiggle for a couple of years now and have been happy with every purchase. From product selection and pricing through to delivery. I live in Sweden where it can be somewhat more expensive to buy similar products, the discounts through Wiggle and their now free delivery make it very beneficial for me. I'll definitely continue to use Wiggle for future purchases.
I bought a groupset but they never sent me this or answered my emails and finally refunded my money.
Very happy with their prices and quick email response. A little slow delivery time. I will buy from Simplyelectronics again.
they might show nice movies.... but they forget to warn you about, that its the same movies they sent every single month. with a single new one here and there if your lucky. waist of money and im even stuck with them for a whole year....
Hexonet provides an easy and smooth user interface and the service is fast and always very helpful and friendly. Even as a small customer, you really feel that your important to them.
Very pleased with my purchase. The shipping was fast and right to the door. The support and service was nothing but the best and Chemical Guys products is wonderful to work with, super effect and long lasting.
Everything arrived in Sweden within a few days of ordering; there was even a converter for the power plug included free of charge. The price was a great deal better than anything I was able to find elsewhere. So all in all very happy.
Quidco works well and have a great customer service if there is a hickup somewhere on the road to cash back. Great website, easy navigation and great functionality overall. Recommended!
I got personally insulted and harassed after writing a review about a website where I purchased a pair of gloves 2-3 years ago and after insulting me due to them missreading my review entirely, the company also filed a report against my review saying that It's "False/Fake". Shortly after being insulted, seemingly months after I sent in the review, I contacted Trustpilot whom not only ignored my support query questioning on how a seller that's not only insulting users who leave criticism but also personally banning them from their service can even be eligable to reply to users but they also went ahead and indulged their report to remove my review entirely after I sent in my Proof of Purchase documents because It didn't meet the magical query that you had to have ordered a product atleast 2 years prior to leaving a review for some magical, inexplicable reason. Ticket status? Why, everything is resolved of course. Enjoy getting kicked in the face some more by abusive sellers and relish in the salt we pour in afterwards into the wound with our moronic terms & conditions.
14 oct 2013 I finally got a confirmation that my money will be refund withing the next 30 day. I also report this company to the police in Sweden because in the first call i made today thet refused to refund the money saying that I have to received the items first which I found abusive, especially since according what Valerie told If i did not got my chairs and lamp bu the 16th of october They should proceed to refund the money, in the evening that day finally a person called and apologize for the confusion and confirm the refund. Two days later The police callled me an asjed me to inform them i I get the money or not bu the 16th november as Infurn said. I hope they do what they have to do. Gaudi and Gerald Paris, order AU208162 6 oct 2013 Im really tired of this of this company. Last week After waiting so long I decided finally cancelled the whole order and get my money back, so Valerie said "the logistics dpt said you will get your order in the next two weeks" so I told her send me a proof of delivery and she still not able to do it. I wonder what infurn do with our money...but I just want my chairs and a lamp, Im pretty sure I will not get anythig by the end of next week...so I ask her to cancelled it and proiceed to a refund but she did not reply! Is that normal? Proceed to the refund of my order AU208162 as soon as possible. I called many times now since I get Valerie's number, she is polite as Infurn is a scam company! Now she says: 1.-she didn't get a proff of delivery from their logistics dpt wherever she is 2.-she is now "today 22-08-2013" waiting for their logistics department in Spain to give her an answe...ok! Theres no telephones in Spain? If yes she doesnt have it! I dont know...how big mistake my husband made to order something at infurn, If that takes 24 hours more I will ask the bank to claim the devolution of our money...! I got that email with valeris details bit it is not a direct mail to reach her, not answer yet, called the phone number and nobody answer the phone!!! Is it possible that to get the name and proof of delivery from Your courier in sweden can take more than two days? I don't believe that. This situation is getting worst every day I just do nOT trust you, any excuse is valid. Just send my order inmediately!!!! LURAD!, already canceled part of my order because if not I would have my table fOr christmas! Still have four chairs and a lamp supposed to be shipped the 22th of july/2013 But nothing yet! And now I am really concern about the refund... Just want my chairs and lamp delivered and my money back from that table I canceled in my order. Would definitely NOT recommend Infurn Answer to Infurn: Regarding cancellation of part of my order, i know since I cancelled the table that it will take 30 workIng days to get the money back. BUT I am worried about it because the shipping is taking so much time I dont want that happens with my money. I didnt get any email with your details yet, hope to get my things this week.
There are aspects that can be improved upon, but the price was right and the delivery was fast.
I ordered a new helmet from The bikerstore Uk on the 21 st of March. Now 3 weeks later it still say`s "awaiting fulfillment" on their website. I have tried to contact The Bikerstore several times but no one answers. It`s kind of funny when you look at the "contact us" page on their website, it says "You can use the contact form below, or call us, use email, pop into the shop, or drop us a note by pigeon... well you can try a pigeon but you're probably better off with one of the other options. Good Luck" Yeah i`ll need it I`m starting to think a pigeon would be the best option now...
I ordered a SixOne Downhill helmet with heavy discount. The size guide was not entirely easy to read but in the end the helmet has a very nice fit (important with helmets). My late night order was shipped the next day. I would definitely recommend Merlin
Greemangaming is a great site where you often find a good deal on games. Purchasing games are fast and reliable since you receive your key or game within a minute. Currency choices are a bit odd here in Sweden  where we have to pay in pounds instead of euro since the switch from dollars was made.
Great pictures where you actually get a feel of the wallpapper, although colours are a bit misleading. Delivered as promised. Good feedback during the shopping and delivery.
Good and trustworthy site with good explanation of the products! Recommend it to you all!
A very smooth and troublefree buy. Have recomended the shop on Photo sites here in Sweden to others that long for a good buy. I will use them again in the future. regards Martin Kaup
Hi, We paid money to them on the 20th of January 2014. After that they have stopped replying us and have not shipped any product to us. We have mailed many times asking for status or a refund but no reply at all. It is now 20th February 2014.
I ordered 2 disks on Tuesday during the day. It is now Friday and still no packages.. When I search for the packages online it still in processing and 1 of the disks not even showing up they sent it as 2 packs. When i ordered it said both disks where on Stock but soon more than 1 week to deliver something on stock is very poor service. I even called their support line, they hide the phone number it took 5-10 min even to find it. Then I called had to wait long time again. Guy that pick up have no clue what going on he say I properly getting today on Friday but again nothing. Very poor service never shop there again.
This is a great shop with great prudukts to great prices, that i would like to recommend.
WARNING NEVER buy air tickets through Expedia!! My boyfriend and I booked our dream trip to Las Vegas through Expedia on the phone. He helped in the customer service was difficult to spell our names so we had to repeat it several times. In the evening we discovered that he had spelled wrong and rang and told them the next day. Since we would go to the U.S., it was important that everything was correct. Expedia did NOTHING to help us! Even though it was their fault and we had not "checked in" yet. NEVER BOOK WITH THEM!
A great service to get games for a real good price, and not getting tricked by other services that treats $38, 38£ and 38€ as the same price. Gaming Panda does NOT, which is a GREAT feature. They also deliver the game fast, and they have security measures against frauds, which in my book is a 5 star rating so far. I've made 5 orders so far, no troubles at all. This service is PERFECT!
They have good clean products. The only bad part was that they didn't read my email before they shipped my stuff so I got one product wrong; I know I should've checked one extra time that everything was correct, but I sent my email about changing my order 16:16 and the order was dispatched 21:15 without looking at my email. Thats 5h, and Im talking CET+2 they have greenwitch time +-0
Was very pleased with how fast the package came and how well it was packed.  Will definitely order from this company again.
The choice of products  ion the website  is remarkably wide, at affordable prices. Information and offered services  Shopping was easy , and delivery was right on time. Using the fountain pens  I purchased is now an every day joy.
Got my key and it worked, But all the mails came to junk folder which i have never experienced before on other key sites.
Very good choice -- that's why it was worth ordering from you although I live in Sweden and the shipping cost twice the value of the order (the order being quite small). The shipment came extremely fast. I appreciated the simple slim packaging. It fit in the mailbox, saving me the hassle of having to go get it at the delivery agent.
It was really simple to order from this site. Good information about the product, not to expensive and fast shipping. The bag lives up to my expectations and I look forward to shop from jamgolf again.
The shipping was a bit longer than i expected, but overall a great experiance.
Order som parts again and they sent them right away. Much to choose from too and Nice prices
Great web site thats easy to navigate, affordable prices compared to stores, I live abroad so my shipment takes up to three weeks, but i always get my order. Love those little free samples you get with your order. Makes my day! Thanks,
I just bought a Tera veteran account code. Really fast delivery and not a bad code. Cheap to for that matter. Would recommend it to anyone actually!
Easy to shop online and the purchase came on time. great!!!
Surfdome used to be good at speedy deliveries also to International customers. In the last couple of months it has taken longer and longer before they ship the goods. When I tried to cancel the order that according to the order history had not been shipped, they refused and lied me straight in the face that my cancellation was too late. After that complete silence fromt them. Arrogant customer service. My last purchase from these idiots!
The shipping took only three days to Sweden and when I had problems with my order they also replied fast and got the problem fixed!
I received my bra, which fits perfectly in just a couple of days after my order. I am very  pleased.
Got my package to Sweden after 4 days. I can really recommend this shop. //. Rickard from Sweden
I book hotels about every second month - and I find Booking.com the site that works best for me. I especially like that you can select between many different options (room size/standard, with or without breakfast, etc) for each hotel.
They were 100SEK more expensive than the cheapest store in Sweden i Just contacted them with about that and they matched their price even one SEK lower I Recived my Package the day after i ordered Perfect
I did some extensive research before ordering my tickets, and OrlandoAttractions.com had the lowest prices of them all, and also the most positive reviews around the internet, and that's why I chose them. I ordered 5 Orlando Flex-tickets from home, and suggested a time for me to pick them up at their office in Kissimmee. They immediately answered and said that the tickets were not available on the exact time that I had requested, but I could pick the tickets up a bit later, which was fine with me. What was exceptional about this was that the time they suggested was outside their normal office-hours, and that's how you make your customers feel special. They kept the office open a bit longer so I could pick my tickets up. Well done, OrlandoAttractions.com. Finding their office and picking up the tickets was no problem, and we had a blast in Orlando. I will definitely use OrlandoAttractions.com again.
Bought an air trip with Jetstar Asia. Just at the end of a long transaction I was informed of a charge of about 6 USD for paying wih my credit card. But since there was no other payment option, they should have mentioned this from the very start. Almost scam!
First time i used Spigen and needed a case for my Nexus 5. So bought the "Slim Armor - Fluorescent Red" case on the Spigen UK site. Expected the delivery to take about a week to Sweden but got it in three days. Price was good and the quality of the case feels top notch!
Rentalcars.com found a really low price for me (Toyota Aygo) and I was also upgraded to a larger car (Toyota Yaris) without cost. Service at pickup was good (could be even faster). At return there was no service (key drop) but who needs service to park the car and drop the key ? The car itself was really, really nice... a small 6-speed manual petrol car with rear view camera.... excellent !
I ordered flowers in the morning before going to work and already saw my friend uploading pics to facebook before lunch. Very pleased.
Competitive prices, a wide range of products, great customer service and quite quick delivery even when shipping abroad. Personally, I'm very happy with my shopping experience and will definitely use Beautybay again!
Sometimes it's a bit daunting to order from a company abroad (I work in Sweden). By now I know I can definitely totally rely on Flashbay and their high level of overseas communication and quality of products.
Lots of interesting an fun gadgets. Mostly low prices - and sometimes low quality; but you get what you pay. A great advantage is delivery by regular mail service, surprisingly fast.
I got on this site and bought 20 Gold for 20USD (I know really expensive) I did not get the gold as it stood directly. So I asked for a refund from one in the Live Chat and was promised one. We chat and got to an agreement. TWO days later when I was playing I noticed an mail and saw I got 20 gold even though I was promised an refund. I contacted the Live Chat directly and asked about this and this is what I got. This is my conversation with one on the Live Chat. Me: Hello I was promised a refund by one of your employees. They: What is your e-mail you bought the order with. Me; Myemail@hotmail.com They: You got the order, we can't give you your money back'' Me: But I was promised a refund from one of your employee two days before it was delivered. They: You got the order, we can't refund you. And by this time they had lowered the price to 50 Gold for 20USD, the day before I got the order. They totally ignore my mails and if I try to contact them by Live Chat. This is the worst experience in my life from any site that exist in the world.
I have looked at Titanfall for a long time and never bought it because of the price at Origin. I searched for used copies at Ebay, blocket and Tradera (Swedish Ebay sites) and they was still to expensive. I finally found a site which showed me dozens of Cd-Key sites available. I looked through them all and Cjs-Cdkeys.com showed as a trustworthy, fast and cheap site so I tried it. I have to say the speed of the delivery and the payment method was fantastic and easy, I got my under 3 minutes, as they have a feature named Auto-Key which send the key as I payed for it. I recommend Cjs-Cdkeys.com to my friends, and I will use it in the future for it's service.
They are fast at the delivery and for me it's a big plus, it's a little wierd you need to link Facebook or send ID of who you are to increase spending limit. I had to do it becuase the product I bought cost more than 80$. Other then that I liked their site, I bought a European Xbox One and couldn't find a place to buy a Gift Card from England so I could buy games. So they saved my life.
We had tried to find spare parts to a fairly new Matsui air conditioner. The large chain store (Elgiganten) was not able to help but could only refer to a large spare parts dealer in Sweden. Unfortunately they could not help either. But Google could, by referring us to PartMaster.
I bought a wrong product but the fixed it really fast.

Jag bifogar mitt klagobrev till interrent, Portugal.. I made a car reservation by a dealing Company in sweden. Ref nr T0919X3216 It was made in swedish money ( 2119 SEK). I also orderd the assuranse for geting the money back if I need too use the assuranse. I get Interrent. Portugal as renting Company,. order no 7012634709. On the document I get it was a number of deposit I have to do wright too 1600  (14720 SEK). I made my booking in sek and therefore it will be Swedish money in the rest of the order. Then I picked ut the car it was Another Company connected too interrent ??? that delivered the car. Maybee it is the same company ???? The like to have a deposit of 1600 EUR, more than the cost for the whole holiday. I didn´t have so much money on may account so they offer me a werry expensive assurance 11 EUR x 14 days 154 EUR. And many extra fee totaly 304 EUR. They raised that to 359 EUR without explaining. They give me a smaller car than I ordered so after one week we changed the car to the right size. They take 25 EUR extra for bringing the car back 5.30 in the morning. No one was there in the morning too take the car and drive us to the airport. We have too run to the airport. Kenneth Lind
Very large  range of quality pens at a very good price. Nice customer service that quickly replied to my questions.
We were a group of 14 who really doubt the many positive reviews this company has got. Our experience is that this is not a professional or reliable company at all. I won't tire you of all the details of a very disappointing experience where we were stranded at Barcelona airport to be picked up by individual taxis. The last 5 of us finally got and paid our own taxi. It caused true mess. The explanations we were offered obviously weren't true. I guess this can happen in really unlucky cases, but what's really disappointing is that the help desk does not answer any of my emails. Their strategy seems to be to ignore us.
Have won a couple or tournies, had fun playing for free and with real cash, easy to use interface, and great selection of low and high stake games. Have and would recommend to friends.
ordered canterbury tech vest to be shipped to sweden, although it was not the cheapest option (i went to JD sports first - which was a complete nightmare..)  found milletsports service was exactly what I was after. Would buy from them again without hesitation.
I really like this site it has an easy interface and really fast and good support.
Ordered a westfalia towbar and cable set for my A6 2012 All was delivered to me in just 5 days. The westfalia manual was a bit of a let down but that is not pfjones fault. There were no instructions at all as to how to dismantle the car, just some arrows saying remove this and that. Also you need to know that on modern cars you need to reprogram the car for a towbar. Other that that, I am happy for this delivery and can recommend pfjones.
All items in shop are really cheap and are high quality
Free delivery to Sweden and just a couple of days to arrive. Good package and informative website, eventhough I couldn´t choose to see the prices in £, only Euro.
Ordered from Sweden and the package actually reached Sweden in just 3 days. Local dellvery took another 3 days. FFX has a multibuy discount so I more or less had my third item for free, or the shipping cost covered . I´ll keep looking for products on their homepage. H.A Sweden
Bought a HITACHI circular saw at a very good price. The deliverychain was quick up until the very last leg, in Sweden. Without that glitch it would have been 5 stars, and I will most likely buy from them again.
Over the last year, I've consistently found Argus Car Hire to be cheaper than other consolidators. Service is swift, price is good, and no quibble cancellation policy works well. Only thing I would take away 1/2 star for is that they won't broker an annual CDW policy and would rather sell you a "per trip" policy which works out much more expensive,
wasn't sure that my little order of  250 was going to be large enough to make enough waves for Flashbay to work hard given the weight the prime clients had. No worries, Anders worked double time to get the proofs to me and choose an appropriate USB stick. Did I say how cheap they were :-)
Frankly speaking, their prices were so good compared to the competition I only put a small order in, figuring it was not so much to lose. The order was put in on Tuesday PM. By Monday AM the brochures arrived in Stockholm, Sweden (from London) bu courier. The quality was unbelievable much better than I had been led to expect. Next time I will place a much bigger order
Had no need to claim but was good for peace of mind
The only way to run Infurn out of of town is for conumers to claim for their purchases from their credit card issuers under sections 54 or 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (or their equivalents in other countries). Given Infurn's absolute refusal to enter into any correspondence (email or otherwise), there is very little burden of proof needed to show either (i) their failure to honor their business contract or (ii) they have fraudulently mis-represented their selling process. Sooner or later, Infurn will be blacklisted by Mastercard and Visa and will not be able to accept either system for merchant payments. Then the whole house of cards will collapse. Let the big boys' lawyers deal with these crooks. That's why the consumer protection is put in place.
Easy to find and alot of images and info on all items. # 1200002769
Placed a bid on a flightcase, bid was accepted and before I knew it I had the flightcase in my possession in Sweden! Item is completely as described. Very easy and troublefree transaction, am very happy with item. I would certainly recommend this company to prospective buyers.
I'm a frequent business and private traveller around the world and for many years I've been using HotelClub. Reaching a destination is certainly fun. But for me the process of travelling is also part of the fun, including the hotel booking with quite many options that allow me full personalization and even collect dollars to be used later on.
Ordered a jacket on Saturday evening and had it delivered to my door in Sweden on Thursday! Excellent. When payment was made on the web, I could print an excellent receipt. Best Internet buy ever!
I was obsessed the second I saw this jacket- and had to have it! The service from Blue was awesome and he helped me pick the perfect size. I did get at trackingnumber for the package. This is true love ;)
I'm using momonod every time I am searching for a flight. It's the only site I use after lookiig into several others several times. Momondo gives the best service and functions I need.
Comperd to Sweden it's quite cheep and the delivery to Sweden is usually less then a week.
Though I know different eye-improving programs work, as my whole family has trained their eyes back to normal. I don't recommend this site or program, due to their customer service and lack of respect towards other people. Improve vision naturally is a direct link to rebuild your vision, where the actual product purchase is made. Be aware that your credit card will be charged $97 after 1 month when you've bought the "rebuild your vision" product. I first tried to contact customer service when this happened to me. Their response were that I had been clearly informed about this on the product buiyng page. I didn't agree and contacted VISA Nordic. They refunded me for the total ammount of $97 due to their decision that the buying site (for rebuildyourvision.com and improve-vision-naturally.com) is fraud, as the customer is not clearly informed about the extra $97 charge, and that this isn't even mentioned on the reciept. Due to the customer service I recieved after buying this product, and the response by the President of rebuildyourvision.com here at Trustpilot, I can't recommend any of these sites. I hope everyone know they'll be charged extra after 30 days. (If you chose to return the product, you'll have to pay postage your self and then wait for the refund).
The company consists only of 2 pages. It's sells a PDF-program for download and a mailed hardcover version of the same PDF. The pages states that the program is free to try, that it absoulutely works, that lots of people recommend it and so on. The customer is told through an "update" that he/she is getting a limited free order. The company states the program has to be purchased within a close upcomming date to get the free order. It furthermore clearly states the product is free and costs zero. The only money you pay is for shipping. My VISA card was debited USD 97 after some 40 days. I contacted the company, clamining a refund based upon what I've described, and that my reciept or order confirmation stated I had baught the program for free and didn't state anything about a trialperiod. My refund was rejected and the company didn't agree the conditions was contradictory in any way. Regarding the program, I recommend people interestet in visionimprovement to try the Bates method or Norbekov method instead, as this didn't fulfill my expectations. I do not recommend either the program nor the company's service or way of doing business. Concerning the company President's reply: VISA debet Nordic has given me a full refund of USD 97 due to their conclusion that your company rebuild your vision is engaged in fraud. VISA's written reply agrees with my complaint on every aspect of the deal between customer and company, particularly regarding rebuild your vision's deliberate hiding of terms and conditions. However, VISA Nordic's also finds it very unprofessional that even the company manager, using the title President on a third-party web page, reveals personal information regarding who is rebuild your vision's earlier customers and not. I predicted this and sadly I were right, which is why you're not able to find me in your database. As I have allready mentioned; as the President of my own eyes I know it's possible to fix the eyes, and the rebuild your vision program might work as good as the Bates method or the many others on the market if you belive in it enough. I find it rather positive that rebuild your vision is making money on this instead of other lies and tricks, but the way they're doing business, if they had only chose to meet the customer with service and respect, and if their terms and conditions were clearly presented, I might have recommended this company - if you truly believe in the product your'e selling, why don't clearly state that the customer is charged $97 after 30 days... Rebuild your vision has made it impossible for me to recommend them to others. I don't think my credit-card company will either.
have several transaktions with this dealer, had no problems at all. fast and reliable!
It took 5 days to get my order from the U.K. to Sweden. I think that is a record in it self! Everything was exectly the way I ordered it. I can not be more pleased- and I will order again, and tell friends about this perfect internet shop Updated: Took 4 days and everything I said before is still valid..
This company is simply great fast shippments even to sweden takes maximum 4 days from i sent the order untill its here great prices and wounderfull stock of supplies i would no doubt recomend this to anyone who use a vaporizer (Sorry if i misspelled anything)
There was an attempt to make the presentation fun, unfortunately, the audience did not get it at all times. I found it as hardcore selling of social media and that is not negative observation. Good to make people aware of how social media has taken over the world (exaggeration? no, Ola would use those words :)
With fast worldwide deliveries and fair prices, I am sure to be a returning customer.
Rentalcars could find me the best deal on the market, quick and easy.
I would heartily recommend the Barcelona city tours. We were 4 adults who ordered this tour from home and it worked very well. We took the East tour one day and western tour the next day. We ordered 3 x tickets for seniors and thought we were good. You see a lot of Barcelona and can decide for what you want to explore a little more during your time in Barcelona.
I can highly recommend Pediwear if you're looking to get top quality shoes at a attractive price level. The service is fast and accurate.
Works perfect every time, with personal service when you have questions or want to change something later. ShopUSA helps you always in the best way, highly recommended!! Thanks ShopUSA!!
Have ordered goods from AmbienteDirect.com twice now with perfect result. The company has kept me up2date with delivery information. Getting much better prices than ordering via Swedish firms and delivery mechanism is the same. From my experience I recommend this firm to anyone and I will soon return with new buys.
This was a good buy - really good little machine and it arrived on time. I would have liked to have it delivered at home, but it was acceptable to pick it up at nearest place (a small videoshop nearby).
Without this site we would never been able to plan our NZ trip from Sweden in such a way! Found great companies for hiring a campervan, normal car hiring, skydiving and river rafting, places to go and see and much, much more. I also bought their app (108 Swedish Krona) which can have the apps and reviews offline(!) which is crucial when driving around in NZ which has useless coverage (or so I heard). So see this as the Swedish equivalent of prisjakt.se with the many reviews and prices on EVERYTHING you can do in New Zealand.
Not that they good the worst rating, notes about scamming people on their insane rates and loosing peoples packages, they also have the WORST support-team I've ever dealt with. It must be a bunch of idiots since they couldn't even understand me, writing to them asking them to stop me sending their subscription-emails since their automatic opt-out function didn't work. They asked me to "please consider a few things before I closed my account(!)". I didn't even ask that! Now, over 4 weeks gone I haven't had any response except that "they will look into this", whilst they didn't do sheit and just keep spamming me with their e-mails. This if course is another board into their coffin since it proves that they do NOT intend to help their customers, not even with the little trivial things. Avoid this company. I mean it.
The game (Beyond - Two Souls: Special Edition) costed about £20 (total: 608 SEK) more in Sweden and I found at Simplygames.co.uk for £40 and £9 for the shipping (international) = £49 which is considering cheap when the "normal" version costs £41 in Sweden. The only downside that takes one star away is that they don't tell you that it will be £9 for shipping (it still says £4,5 at the checkout and on my receipt it says £2,5 each(!) which is quite worrisome if you order 2 or more games).
I love that you can review sites, a big thing since Amazon nor any other international site has that function. Seems legit? Definitely. Edit: On other parts, it seems that TrustPilot are quite useless at posting bad reviews by making it mekky to get them posted. Fix this TrustPilot and you will achive more trust! Cause you just lost some of mine.
This website have the best prices in Europe, but be ready to not have any information at all after you put in your order. It took them over one week to process my order, and this was not any custom fitting. Also I sent a mail to get some info about how long time I would have to wait but I never got any answer!!! No email that the order was on it's way, I'm just happy I got it now but after waiting a long time !
It is much to choose from but the images on the website are very small which makes it harder to decide. But no shipping fee and very fast delivery makes it a great Wayne to buy buffs. Thank you
extremely simple to book and have it deliverde within the UK
quick, convenient, products as advertised - no surprises. I am a returning customer - satisfied again.
Ordered a pair of glasses with prescription and could pick them up on the 7:th day in Sweden. Price, is less than 50% off compared with a local store, for the same frame, same lens and same coating. Excellent!
I received 4 out of my 5 orders emailed Bohoo twice and still ahve not heard back from them.
you look for good service, good prices and good selection, you should buy from Pediwear
I ordered a product on a Sunday evening and had it delivered in Sweden at lunchtime on Thursday, that is really a short shipping time considering that the shipping was included in the price. The ordering process was easy to follow. I will most likely return as a customer at the Cyclestore in the not too remote future!
Quality products, perfect customer service. Am very glad and excited I found this company, I've used their cards two times now and will still use them uncountable times. Thanks from a very satisfied customer.
Stay away from this company. Used to be good in the past, now they are a disaster. Been waiting for months for orders that where advertised as in stock. Today the website is temporarily closed for maintenance, wonder if it ever will reopen and if will get my orders... Stay away.
Go2arena has such low prices, tha I was prepared to be ripped off. But everything went so smooth and delivery was so fast that I was up and playing the same night.
Dribbble is a really great site with really great people and the quality of content is excellent. Some of the best designers in the world use this, and it is inspirational. If I had one criticism it would be that the "in-crowd" sort of dominates the site. It's not impossible to get noticed, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to supersede the top "Players". I am a member now, and will continue to be a member for the foreseeable future, and I recommend it to anyone.
I find it hard to stop circulating through the brilliant curated images on this site. One of my favorites, for sure.
I normally keep folders of cool images anyway, but now I have an organized way to save them and a lot of different ways to save them, wherever I am. I think they nailed it.
With the power that PayPal has, they aren't doing much to leverage it. The registration process is painful and they haven't innovated a fraction as much as they could have. I eventually deleted my account because there were many easier options.
Google is an amazing company, and this would have been five stars if Google+ had been better and if Google Wave hadn't been a retarded mash-up of unnecessary features. Otherwise, Google has changed the entire internet for the better.
I have ordered many, many books from Amazon, and have never had a problem with a product. Good sellers, good information, and easy-to-find search results. The design of the site really needs to be updated though, and one time a book was actually not in stock when I ordered it, so I waited three weeks to find out it wasn't coming.
It was perfect.I absolutely recommend to any person who wants to buy perfume or ...
Excellent and friendly service on the phone, although a bit disappointed you could not ask for your flowers to be delivered at a specific time. Otherwise a realiable company.
I had ordered several products via Fyndiq, instead of browsking and searching through separate stores. Fast delivery within days almost always. One parcel never arrived - I got proper reclamation handling. Parcel was delivered, invoice moved to further days. So it worked well. Kind, and well done handling! I can only recommend.
I bought my shoes on Monday and they were delivered on Friday (I live in Sweden) and I could constantly track my product. The shoes that I bought was much cheaper to order from Jd's. Very good service and delivery times, will definitely buy more products from this site.
As a customer of SmartBuyGlasses I'm urging al potential customers that SmartBuyGlasses is incompetent, totally unprofessional and completely mistrustful retailer and DO NOT RECOMMEND any kind of trade. P.S. My order is postponed for the fourth time and I'm steel waiting my products!
Ebay sends emails years after I have unsubscribed to there information! I will NEVER shop here again!
I emailed Infurn support concerning a question and it took FOREVER to get an answer - not acceptable. The product I received was ok, but there could have been a users manual enclosed.
Speedy shipment and nicely wrapped as I paid for that.
I've never had better service then at spelbutiken.se. I'm very pleased & recommend this store to everyone!
I always check with Wiggle before I make a purchase of bike- or other sports equipment. In most of the cases Wiggle is the cheapest shop. Especially as they ship for free to Sweden when the purchase exceeds 500 SEK. All the great brands are stored and the shipping to Sweden is fast.
Amazing range in the inventory especially when including the secondhand books. I've managed to fill in some gaps in my library!
The casual kilt package was a nice surprice! We ordered one package to see if it´s something for the new pipe band we´re starting up. We are not rich and want to buy good looking equipment for good value. Now  we have found it. We payed £15 extra for a dress sporran and that´s definately worth the money to look a little more nice. We are a very small pipe band, but we will make a new ord order to buy equipment for all of us. The only negative thing was that the delivery took longer time than promised.
100% trustworthy and serious company but DPD who are delivering the packages for them are a joke... still waiting for my package, it's at some hub but when I search for it trough their trackingsystem it says my postcode is invalid.... it is not. And they claim they've tried to deliver it 4 times to my door but I've been home and noone has been here to deliver it
Web site a bit slow at times, but calls are connected very easy and without any difference compared to a standard direct call. Payments are instant and simple. iPhone app is quite sleek aswell.
The excellent service provided by e-booker makes med recommend you to using their services concerning your trip abroad.
I ordered all of the Pokémon TCG WC decks from 2013 and got them quite fast, as usual, from Chaos Cards. Though after I opened one of them, I realized that the deck had some faults with cards appearing more than four times, which they aren't supposed to. After I've gotten into touch with customer service at CC, I was told to file a complaint at Pokémon International which said that they couldn't do anything. I was then told by CC to file a complaint at their distributor which said that they couldn't do anything. After that, I was told to send the deck back to the UK and quite soon after that, I got my deck replaced. It could have been handled more smooth but I still like them for their prices and I will definitely buy from them again!
I'd never heard of Beautybay before this purchase, but the price was half of what I'd been paying before, so I gave it try and... I like it! The delivery was fast, even though it was shipped from another country (I'm Swedish), and the product was just as good as the one that I usually buy for double the price.
Fast response from linuxpusher when I had trouble to pay with paypal payment. It took me some time to find the helpful answer in my mailbox spam folder. The Tux Fan merchandise was appreciate by me and Linux friends. JR serco
Odrered a Shoei Hornet DS with free extra visor and free oxford Delivered at my door only a few days later. Trustworthy, and a very good price. Strongly recommended
I live in Sweden and found out this site is cheap and has good stuffs
This is a company that you can rely at. The products seems good. You just have to wait for delivery, but it is worth it as the products are cheap.
I'v got my CD-keys just a minute after I payed. It was fast, and EASY. All information how to pay and get everything running was easy to understand and it worked very good! Because it was so smooth and easy and CHEAP, the price was the best we could find, my three friends also bought cd-keys from this place.
I needed a few items from a brand that isn't available in Sweden and found Alwaysriding.co.uk in an online search. Although I am always a bit apprehensive to try new online suppliers, the people at Alwaysriding put my concerns at rest right away with their prompt acknowledgement and fast execution of the order. The delivery from the U.K. to Sweden was fast and my goods arrived at my local postal outlet within a week.
When I arrived to James Andrews School they tolled me that no more students in my level where expected which meant that I where going to be one to one with the instructor "Ollie" I thought he probably would try to make this two planned days shorter due to that. I was disappointed traveling all the way from Sweden to have 2 days of total dedication. I was totaly wrong, Olie gave me two full days and where unbelievable dedicated himself! He gave me 15 inures brake in the morning session, lunch quick to be able to reach our goals. I will go back and I am looking forward to do it!! Rune Mossberg Stockholm Sweden
Difficult to understand why AVIS wanted me to sign a paper in which they want me to charge with 70,95 eruo if I don't bring back the car with a full tank. They call it an option. I was very suspitious about that and thought they want to trick me. It would be better to have this thing as a condition in the contract. "If customer returns car with not a full tank AVIS will charge customer for refueling with xx Euro" That would be much clearer for the customer. Else I was very happy with the service from Avis.
Great way to earn money. If you have a large circle of friends, you just need to inform them about upcoming events and earn money for every purchase they make.
Good and functional website. It processes great number of airline companies and flights, so you can find some really great deals.
I recently bought a joystick from them and it works really good. The website could use some redesigning though.
I love my furnitures from blue sun tree. very helpful custumersevice and fast and secure refund when I changed my mind after makeing an order. It is prepayment when ordering but no problem to get money back if you change your mind. I live in north sweden and furniture in stock delivered in one week.
I've never had to deal with returns, so I can't say anything on how they handle problems and such, but the delivery is quick and mail response on pre-sale questions have been ok. I'd recommend Merlins and I'll continue buying from them when needed.
Really nice prices combined with over sea shipping makes this a very interesting site for European people who like scents and/or are into traditional shaving.
Do not buy anything from this company! Has been waiting over 2 weeks for delivery. Impossible to get in contact with Proviation by phone or over online-chat, only an answering machine. They only answer to your mails after several mails  to them, and the answers are like "we will come back to you ...". Asked for a refund without any response. Beware of this so called "company"!
Well, i double checked before buying and lyko always has the best prices. For the site to be perfect I would only hope to one of these days find the English option as my Swedish is a bit limited. Thank you
The sofa bed is excellent and I love it. Two things; 1. It'd be very practical if Bolia also did a small selection of mattresses, 2. I'd pay a little extra to get a wider selection of accessories e.g. a wider selection of legs. But I do love my sofa, and I sleep in it every night❤️
This is the best website for beauty, its so cheep and I love the products. The only thing i could complain about is the long delivery time. But I live in Sweden so so that explains why :)
Received the software that I ordered and it worked on two computers as stated. Will use them again.
Hi I would like to comment Your request but I do not understand  the german language Can You send me Your question in english ? many thanks best regards
Was a bit unsure at first, checked the facebook page and people were pleased with the company so I bought a gamecard and got the code within 3 minutes! Awesome! :3
Easy to order from, friendly and easy to get help from. Really good prices and great offers.
I bought 2 pc gaes from this company and cannot find a bad thing to say about them. Order arrived quickly and together which was great, some companies send out games separately which is rather annoying. I would not hesitate in recommending this company.
My father- in- law tried to buy me a jacket from this company whilst on holiday at my home (I live abroad).  However, the shop staff have ideas above their station and accused me of being a criminal!  They have refused to process the order as the card-holder lives at a different address, despite the website stating that they will ask for ID and/or proof of residency.  Since when did shop staff become fraud investigators? Absolutely shocking! Unless you wish to have libellous accusations thrown at you, do not use this company!
Recently bought a Kindle Fire HD from amazon.com as I was unable to order one from amazon.co.uk (for some reason, unless you live in the UK, amazon.co.uk don't want your business or your money when it comes to the Kindle, despite the fact that I live in another EU member state!).  The gadget was sent to me quickly from the USA and almost as soon as I received it,  I started to try to download apps to customize it to my specification.  However, I have now found out that because I do not live in the USA or have an American credit card, I am not even able to download some supposedly free apps!  Huh?  Surely the World Wide Web does what it says and is not supposed to be geographically  restricted by amazon - or anyone else for that matter!  Why was I not made aware of these restrictions before I bought and paid for my Kindle?  Turns out that I have paid a large amount of money (I had to pay extra tax because I ordered the Kindle from the USA!) for what is nothing more than a glorified e-reader.  What a waste of money!  I would have been much better off just buying books and using my PC for everything else....! Beware if you are considering buying a Kindle from Amazon as you may not be able to use it for anywhere near the amount of things you thought you would! It's a shame, too, as it's a great little gadget, but only if you can utilise it's full potential!
What an amazing service from start to finish.  I have used high street opticians and supermarkets in the past and had many problems with the glasses not quite being right. After moving abroad I found that glasses are charged per lens and frames etc seperately making it very expensive.  Glasses direct make it very simple to choose and order, and my glasses turned up by UPS 7 days later and are perfect. I can't recommend this company highly enough.
We chose to use Hunts International for our move from the UK to Sweden - what an extremely bad choice!  Not only did they provide a smaller van than we had paid for, they also caused a lot of damage to our old house, plus paid no attention to the delivery date we had requested and turned up two days early meaning we incurred substantial extra costs.  In addition to this, quite a few things were not even delivered!  We are currently compiling a compensation claim against this company, but if you are considering using them, be very careful as their contract is very one-sided - it gives a maximum value of just 40GBP per item, box or set and even I know that my larger items of furniture are worth a lot mare than 40GBP!  They also don't like bad reviews and get quite stroppy if you have the nerve to criticise their work, despite the fact that they don't stick to the terms of their own contract! If I ever emigrate again, I would rather use a man with a van that this bunch of charlatans!
I left a fairly poor review of this company as my experience with them was far from great.  However, I have since received their response to my review and they have now made me certain that I will never use this company again!  The item I originally ordered was NOT shown in their clearance goods, but was on the normal page advertising snowshoes (yes, someone else has also had the same problem that I had with this company advertising items they know are out of stock & unavailable!).  I agreed to accept a lesser pair of snowshoes instead and the money I had overpaid was refunded - no grumbles there!  However, for edge&wax to state that the reson the goods took so long to reach me was that I was not in the fiirst time delivery was attempted is complete rubbish!  Not only was I keeping a very close eye on the progress of my order, when the order did turn up, it was delivered by the normal postman and NOT a courier!  45GBP for the Swedish post office to deliver my goods five days after they had arrived in the country is an exceptionally poor show and for edge&wax to LIE about this is even poorer.  I also find it amazing that edge&wax can even try to fool people into believing them, as there was nothing shown on the delivery schedule to state that the first delivery had been unsuccessful!  Either the courier company who edge&wax choose to use is wrong or edge&wax is wrong! I may have given this company the benefit of the doubt before, but they have made my mind up - disgustingly poor service and I will never use them again!
Do not use this company!  We paid four thousand pounds for our possessions to be transported from South London to Sweden and have had nothing but disgusting service since we paid.  Damage was done to the property we were leaving, damage was caused to our property before it was even loaded into the van, which was smaller than we had paid for, so we were forced to pay extra for another van to transport the balance of our stuff and then our possessions were delivered two days earlier than we had requested, meaning a substantial amount of extra costs to us!  We have contacted Hunt's International to inform then that we intend to claim compensation from them and they have chosen to ignore us.  We checked our belongings when we arrived in Sweden (and 2 days after they had been left at the storage facility) and it looks as though they have been thrown into the storage container.  We have, at this moment in time, no way of even knowing whether all our belongings have been delivered. Use at you peril!  Unprofessional, untrustworthy, unresaonable and unhelpful!  We could have damaged our belongings ourselves and saved the four thousand pounds!  Absolutely disgusting! This is Hunt's International (Removals) Ltd and/or Hunts-International.com, company number 2969895.
Wow!  What a great find!  This online estate purports to market your house on all the major websites, plus a few less well known ones and gives three payment options for their services, all of which are extremely reasonable.  We had tried a couple of high street estate agents and to be quite honest, they were rubbish - not returning our calls, not replying to emails, not even telling us who was viewing our house or getting our house details correct!  Needless to say, we lost all faith in them, so decided to bite the bullet and try an online agent...... eMoov charged us just £299 + VAT (a total of £354) with an unlimited time period to show our house on loads of major websites, including Rightmove, Fish4Homes, Findaproperty to name but a few.  They then fielded the calls and rang or emailed each time someone requested a viewing, and we sold our house within the first week, despite having been on the market with high street agents for the previous six months! Exceptionally good value for money, great service, lovely and fully approachable staff - we would quite happily recomment this company to anyone who wants to sell their house!  They do not 'value' so get a few high street agents round first, but then save yourself a fortune and go with eMoov!
Ebay Buyer Protection is not worth the keystrokes!  I purchased an item, paid using PayPal and the item arrived damaged.  I contacted the seller immediately and received no response, so raised a dispute through Ebay.  I had to wait three weeks, plus return the damaged item to the seller at my expense, plus had to prove when and where the returned item had been sent before a refund was offered, but only of the original purchase price, not the extra costs!  This means I am over 50% of the original price out of pocket, but Ebay has washed its hands as it considers it 'job done'. I will NOT be using Ebay.co.uk again as it seems that Ebay is only interested in protecting itself and its sellers, with innocent buyers way down its list of priorities!
I have used this website several times in the past with no problem and have found their range of books comprehensive and competitively priced. The only problem I encountered was a book I ordered last month which failed to arrive.  I contacted The Book Depository to inform them and they advised that I should contact Royal Mail to see whether they were holding the item for me (no, they were not), but Royal Mail suggested I wait a few more days.  The book still did not arrive, so I informed The Book Depository who duly agreed to send me out another copy at no charge to myself.  This second book HAS arrived so I am more than happy with the service offered by this company and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone!
The service center i went to was national tyre and autocare in redhill surrey and I must say they couldnt have been better. Quick and polite, I will certainly be using them again.
We have ordered items from Wool Overs before and were very impressed with both the quality of items available and the speed and efficiency with which they were sent to us.  As such, we were more than happy to order again - and remain just as impressed with this company, despite the fact that we now live in Scandinavia so postage was always going to be more of an issue! Once again, the items we ordered are of great quality and were sent quickly.  Despite the extra distance they had to travel to reach us, they all arrived in good condition and the postage cost to get them to us was very reasonable! All in all, a very pleasant shopping experience which we are sure we will repeat again and again and again.....
I had to wait over for over two moth on my items. They got lost in the transport and in order to get Beautybay to send me new items I hade to wait for 20 workingdays and then contact them again. I then ( after 1 month ) recived a complaint form that I hade to fill in and send to them. As I a over one week later still havent recived my order I contacted Beautybay again and they had forgotten to send my order?. When I asked for some form of compensation for waiting over two moth they said no. I dont think this is a good way to keep customers and I am dissapointed in the " service"
I have not received my ordered items. It has now been almost 2 weeks. Other letters and packages from China or the UK will arrive in a few days. Do you send your gods with turtle mail. Why not express and air mail. A valid tracking number had been gratefully.
They delete, already confirmed booking, without any notice or explanation. Refuses to answer mails and to try to clear out the mess they create. The only response to mail is rude ones like "don't send any more mails". Keep away!
They scam you. Still have not received the cd-key I bought yesterday and was told it would be delivered within 10 minutes. I'm filing a chargeback with my bank.
Lovely selection of items at good prices..as well as a smooth shopping experience and well-packaged items upon arrival!
I live outside the UK and order items that I cannot get here. Ordering and delivery are easy and reliable, and I have my items within a few days. Great!
This company does not have a phone number you can call for customer service. You are able send an  e-mail, but don't expect answer within the first two following days. The logistic center is in Germany which could make return awfully expensive. Good to know!
Almost two months ago I contatced Babycare through e-mail at 'support@babycare.nl' .  Haven't had any answer yet though. I have also tried to call them, without success. Thereafter I sent Babycare a private message on Facebook, hoping for better luck. No answer. So wrote to them on their Facebook wall to get their attention. Still no answer! They must have seen my messages since they are making updates. This is my last way out, hoping for an answer here on Trustpilot. My order ID is  #70229
Easy, fast, nice price! Ordered hair products for a very nice price, i live in Sweden and got my delivery right down my postbox about one week later - no freight cost, no vat, the price on site is what you pay, good payment flow, goods as expected. I will order more :)
We bought a sofa on the campaign "By now in November and have it delivered before Christmas". The sofa was delivered in Mid-January... so before Christmas 2015, but that was the wrong year...
The order was speedy and i recieved a mail that i had ordered an item and that the codes would be delivered within the hour. But nothing happened for one hour, two, twelve..the next day i contacted OnePlay. Great service! I got assisted really quick with their online service and they helped me out. Turns out that i didn't have enough money in my account. They should have sent a mail out saying "the order was cancelled due to..." Otherwise im satisfied.
Alwaysriding have a very good radar on every incoming E-mail and answers them within a couple of minutes and for me this is very important. They also have a nice and modern web site and they are good at finding the very best cycle clothing. I particularly like the brands using merino wool i the clothes. In cold and warm climate merino wool is a superb material.
Fast, no hassle, good payment options, good automated system and fast delivery. Suites my need for a fast reliant supplier of gamecodes for a very competative market price.
I have never experienced such back service as at Bolia. I had to wait several weeks for the sofa I bought and when it was to be delivered it turned out that Bolia had not been able to draw money from my credit card and therefore could not deliver the sofa - something that I found out by coincident when I, since I hadn't heard anything at all - went into a store and asked to make sure the sofa was to be delivered. Despite me having no problems what so ever with the card, and despite me making a separate payment directly to Bolia, e-mailing the recepit of the bank transfer, to Bolia, they didn't deliver the sofa. Then, it turned out they only deliver once a week, and since nobody told me that and when the sofa was to be delivered I was not home when they were supposed to come, which mean that I had to wait extra for it. Communication with Bolia customer service was extremely slow. In the end, I got my sofa and I was refunded the cost for delivery, but I have told all my friends never to buy at Bolia and will certainly never do so again. Bolia has severe problems with operations and communications and need to take in expertise to solve that. More can be expected from a store with furniture in this price range.
Dirtbikebitz is one of the best MX site I usually order from. I have never had any problems with them, and I have ordered pretty much at the same time. Quick delivery to Sweden, is rather Swedish postal service which takes time. Have nothing bad to say about Dirtbikebitz.
I purchased a Seiko watch for a very good price, it came safely and very fast delivered right to my front door, Im very impressed, I recommend Creationwatches to everybody it can`t be better.
Well no complains about the service and the shipment, but the quality off the merchandise is insufficient, one of the wrist watch straps I bought broke the second day. No more comments needed.
Recommended 2 friends to go GMG after my purchase because of good prices, longer sale and a quick and easy purchase. Even got a little money to spend on more games.
I ordered the item from Lambda-Tek, and I had it only a few days later! Great experience and great delivery :)
I have ordered a few items from QuietPC and there is nothing to complain about, even if it need to be shipped to a different country the delivery speed is quite Amazing & I really like how each and every item is described with as much information as possible and with more then one image
Took a few hours to get the key, but it was quite cheap and worked perfectly.
The delivery was a little slow (but that can be because of slow postal services, not necessarily BeautyBay's fault), otherwise everything was great!
Great products and easy purchasing process. Super fast delivery to Europe! Will definitely buy more sunglasses soon!
After years of paying over the roof markups on life's essentials here in Sweden, I stumbled upon BCS by chance. After having placed my first order I must say that I'll be returning and how impressed I was. The only negative experience was the courier, but that's hardly BCS fault. Maybe BCS could offer more than a choice between two couriers?
I always use this website if I want to book hotel. This is the best site I have ever seen. And the last but not least: very good prices.
bra saker och billigt men lite si och så med leveranstider
Wow, the jacket I got from Muubaa is the coolest ever, I look so good in it and it feels as if it loves me. And I think the company loves me too, the whole procedure from website to receiving the jacket was absolutely great, service, quality, fast and service when it's as its best. Love Muubaa!
I odered an album and it came fast and it is very good quality. Thanks
I never had problems with hotelclub.com bookings under 7 years now....and I will continue to use it and recomment to my friends.
Website easy to use, setting up details for ordering very simple. Excellent, efficient and prompt service with full follow up on the status of the order at all stages i.e. from receipt of order to packing, collecting etc etc. Very impressed!
I placed an order and I recieved my items, but I returned two out of three items since they didn't fit me, I mean, what do I do with clothes that neither fit me or flatter my body shape? Return of course! My ISSUE with my return came to the refund and the return cost. The total value of the items I wanted to return and was to be refunded was $79,92 but returning them cost me $47,39 alone. I've almost never been charged return costs since most companies won't charge it as a part of good costumer service but even a smaller return cost wouldn't bother me but seeing as MORE THAN HALF of my refund money will go to cover the return costs I feel scammed. Isn't there a better way to handle returns? I'm sad to say I won't order from Chicwish again due to this. (Worth to mention is that I did contact them about it but never got a reply.) (Also, I give them two stars because I don't believe they'd do this with ill will and also because their clothes come with great quality and style. I think you should order if you're sure and - ONLY THEN - that you don't need to return any of your purchased items,)
Super god service and fast delivery. I am very pleased
The products as well as the customer services reps are clearly beyond our expectations. Even our request for partial delivery to Sweden was managed in a superior way I can clearly recommend buying from Bluesuntree!
I tried to purchase a game from 2 different websites (3 times in total). Each time I was given an error message that my creditcard was not accepted. I later found out that (despite the error and no delivery) the money was withdrawn from my bankaccount all three times. I contacted the websites who told me to contact Nexway, who manages the payment and delivery. They dont even answer my mails.
I would like also to express my absolute disappointment about the new policy of Amazon that from April 3, 2014, FREE Super Saver Delivery is no longer available for many European countries. I have been ordering lots of products from this company during the last 3-4 years, spending hundreds of pounds every month and I have been very satisfied with the professionalism that Amazon used to have. Unfortunately starting from the 3rd of April Amazon will lose the vast majority of the regular European customers including my family. It seems that for Amazon's management it does not matter: - the fact that net sales increased 22% to $74.45 billion, compared with $61.09 billion in 2012  (excluding the $1.28 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the year,which means that net sales grew 24% compared with 2012). - the fact that operating income for 2013 increased 10% to $745 million, compared with $676 million in 2012. - the fact that the unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the year 2013 on operating income was $29 million. -finally that the net income for 2013 was $274 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $39 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in 2012. I know that Amazon, probably the biggest and most profitable online sales company (for the moment) in the world, tries to reduces costs or just tries to increases profit. This is not the first time that there have been changes in the rules that force loyal customers to pay more. But this time that's beyond the limits and I am more than sure that it is NOT the customers but Amazon itself that will hurt from this. Most of the products on Amazon are now more expensive than local retailers (it is ridiculous to pay more for delivery than the value of the product) therefore it is pointless for me and any other customer to continue ordering from this company. This decision from the Amazon.co.uk management made me realize that they are too big, too powerful and too greedy and it's time online consumers started to support alternative online retailers in order to maintain the competitive balance. If we don't, it won't be long before Amazon are the only choice. It turns that it is a really bad time to be an Amazon customer. Even if they will finally decide to change it back .the trust between this company and the customers is broken. What a pity.. P.S. I think it is the best time to get rid off the Amazon stocks
Exellent! I have bought from this site/company several times and always with a good experience. PROS: + Items specified in stock are really in stock. + Quick dispatch of order. + Shipment sent is always possible to track. + Questions are answered within 24 hours (not weekends or holidays). + Quick delivery (around 1-2 days within Sweden). + Quality Items to decent prices. + If a item for some reason have been sold out they notify you and pay you back if you want to. CONS: - Do presently only accept orders within Sweden
I have bought from this site/company one time and I will never do it again! CONS: - Items specified in stock are really not in stock. - Shipment sent is not possible to track. - Questions are answered without information and with threat of legal actions. - Ordered item did never arrive at my door. PROS: + Large amount of products. + Decent prices. Note: About 30 days after my package have been sent (according to the company) I contested the payment since a shipment between UK and Sweden not should take that long. I got my money back. Today 42 days have passed.
When I buy things on internet, it usually take up to more than a week for the goods to arrive, in this case it only took 3 working days from my order to delivery of the goods -  directly in my hands from the Postman. Well done! I would also say that there´s a solid selection of my favorite things on this webbshop, so I will probably shop some more in the near future.
I have used Sigma several times, each time with good service, would thoroughly reconmend
When booking Firefly (via Holiday Autos, so I couldn't choose myself which company I would get) for a short trip in Nice, FR I got immediately suspicious when a bunch of fees were listed on the contract I had to sign. Among the normal gas fee there was a cleaning fee of 15 Euros, something they call "fast return" of 24 Euros which turned out to be a fee they just take for no obvious reason and on top of that a 5 Euro credit card surcharge. Since the car was already prepaid via Holiday Autos I had no choice but to sign the contract. So a car that originally should cost 104 Euros ended up costing me 140 Euros. The car itself was a very worn Opel Meriva. Mechanically it ran ok, but the scratches and bumps both inside and outside were endless. Also the interior were heavily worn and my wife even got the door handle in her hand when trying to close the door at one occasion since it was loose. The car was rather filthy both inside and out when we received it. So if you book through Holiday Autos and get Firefly, unbook immediately. This company is a scam! Better book directly from the big companies! I know I will! Update 20140715: After I complained to Holiday Autos I will now receive a refund for the so called "fast retur" and also the credit card fee. So if you are in the same situation do complain! With enough people doing so FireFly will hopefully be taken away from Holiday Autos partners.
What can I say, Alpinestars means quality, and FC-Moto delivers the products fast and at a awesome cheap price, couldn't get it cheaper in Europe. Will gladly buy from them again.
This is a company who have a great service to offer, but.. To be a customer is not that easy, they take long time to answer support requests and they ban you on Facebook if you send them messages and comment their posts about your requests. I still waiting for them to take care about my support request, I have waiting over a year now and I have resent the request over and over again. NO ANSWERS! If you want to spend money on videos, find something else!
Definitely less expensive than purchasing from domestic Internet stores in Sweden! Delivery time was perhaps a bit long, but what the heck, delivery was FREE!
I freaking love Beauty Bay, they have great prices and every beuaty-need you have to have:)
I ordered a dress and got the order confirmation, but a few days later I recieved another email saying that the dress I ordered was out of stock and that I'd get a full refund. I then contacted Asos and asked them why this had happen (the status of the dress was "in stock" at the website) and they blamed the technology. Anyways... I reordered the dress and it seems that everything is working fine! My point is, Asos needs to improve their contact between warehouse and website. I was  really disappointed when I recieved the mail! It's difficult to get in touch with Asos. On the website there's no place for me as a customer to form my own question. They can be contacted through Facebook, but how fair is that to those who do not have it? There should be an email address! I'm sure that my experience would have been different if it was easier to contact them. I expected more from Asos since it's such a big company. I made a return which I had to pay for myself. 25 euro to be precise. Very expensive! I'm sure a company like that can afford to provide re-payed return labels for their customers outside UK! BUT I still have to say that they have a great supply and the quality of their products seem to me fine. There are lots of pictures and videos where you get to see the product before purchasing.
I found this site on the Web, while looking for a cheap oscilloscope. I would recommend it to everyone.
Easy to navigate, easy to get a quote and then do a booking
Posten in sweden has a webshop that you can NOT trust. When you buy they deduct the Money 3 times by only make one delivery. After 38 mail's they do not want to give me my Money back. They just say that they can't find out how to do it ??????
Good homepage with easy accessable products with excellent pictures. Easy to order, fast handeling an a really good tracking system with DHL. I'm very satisfied and got exactly what I wanted but at a much lower total price than what I could get here in Sweden.
I found it easy to search for products on the website, I liked that you can search by labels. You have good prices on your products but the waiting time for the delivery was a little bit long. But I rather wait a little longer for delivery than pay more for it.
A good source of supplements, reliable and affordable prices. Dispatched the same day ordered. A very large choice for the serious athlete. I highly recommended this company and their site.
Good information about my order, an amazingly fast delivery to Sweden, and I felt very comfortable, with the bargain (purchase), from order to delivery. My order wasn't exactly as I ordered, but only one email, and, just about an hour after, they gave me o good offer, that I was really pleased with. Really serious, good service, fast and secure and I will for sure, buy moore from Gear4music. Very good!
I have used them two times and it works very well. If you seem to have any problem with the DPD deliverance and you live outside Germany,  just phone reifentiefpreis and they will help you.
I bought their lights for two bikes. In all four lights of which one did not work. I mailed Reelight at once but after twelve days and two e-mails, still no response?! Reel bad.

Fast , flexible and very friendly service . My new shoe supplier. Thanks a million.
Fast delivery and very good product! I will order again and again!
Do not buy from this page. Total scam! I've waited 6 weeks for my glasses with spec. when normal delivery time is 2 weeks. The cancelled the order due to too long time but i have'nt got my money yet! DO NOT ORDER!
Great prices and quick deliveries. If there is a problem with your order, they solve it in a way benifiting you as a customer. The only minus I can find is that the selection of football boots might be a bit small, otherwise they are as close to perfection as you can come.
Denney Diving have many of the accessories that I need for my diving. They have good service and fast deliveries.
My old chainset broke and I quickly needed to change it before the following bike race. Wiggle had a suitable Dura Ace compact chainset in stock and at a good price. I also took the opportunity to change the bottom bracket, also Dura Ace. I asked Wiggle to deliver the parts as fast as possible and the parcel was sent out the day after my purchase. It arrived a couple of days later and I had good time to install and adjust everything. The Dura Ace components are excellent. The bike race was a success thanks to Wiggle. Outstanding customer support! I highly recommend them!
I bought a pair of Time Xpresso 8 pedals. The pedals are very good and I am happy I decided to buy them. I recommend you to buy from Merlin Cycles: * Good price * Fast shipping * Excellent communication
I am from Sweden and I had a fabulous time ordering from them. everything worked just fine on email and phone
All item was perfect and shipping was  very fast and price was also very reasonable so 100% recom to all five *****.
Just love shopping at BeautyBay... Nice prices and I've never had to wait for a product cause it was out of stock..
Everything went smooth, prices are very good and many games for sale!
The live support is online all the time. They ship fast and care very much about their customers
Really good prices on the products that I need every month! Fast delivery, very good online service on their site! Easy to use! I have been buying my suppliments from another online-site for about one year now, but never again! I dont have any negative to say in regards to the whole process!
Received my goods here in Sweden in perfect condition a few days after ordering. Great website, prices much lower than in nearby stores here in Sweden and more to choose from. Highly recommended.
I Order both clothes and ps3 games from Sweden. This ships from England and it´s goes really fast. Sometimes I get it in 4-5 days and that is a short time for me. Easy payment and I often gets discount offers.
Why is there other models of women's shoes and boots in size 42/43? I do not like them at all. NOT AT ALL. I ask for the usual models in larger sizes. Do the usual range of women's shoes which are now up to 41 up to 42/43! Make MORE number 42 available for the stylish shoes in the cases where they exist in 42. It should go to get your shoes also for us who have larger sizes. In many cases we have normal feet just a little longer. I am so tired of those ugly "options" that you offer to us with big feet. I am tired of paying lots of money for shoes that I think are good looking just because no options I LIKE in my size! I wonder how many we are having the same problem??
Thumbs up for Boozt.com. I found items in their store in an inspiring navigation and got my order delivered fast. Nice choice of brands and free freight if you shop for more than 250 SEK. Thumbs up I say. Thumbs up.
Had bought lots of goods were always good but a mascara ordering got problems. The mascara I had bought was completely dry complain got new mascara pretty fast but it was too dry could not complain even more mascara was very expensive otherwise they are really good, and respond to customer service to me it's a little difficult to buy at the back.
Default ticked boxes for extra costs are illegal in Sweden! Noticed it immediately after paynig since the cost was not equivalent to what was presented during the purchase. Mailed their customer service within minutes but they gave me a BS story about how stressed they were so they could not handle this case...Really bad business, will never use again!
A lot to shoose from (even for old systems) with good and professional information. Delivery was faster than stated  and the package was very well wraped. Highly recomended with good prices as well.
Order was paid for by credit card, No delivery 3 month later and an estimated delivery 10 months later. Not acceptable and very unsatisfactory.
Always good service and good communication. Nice stuff and I will buy from this site again and again!
Just 5 days in total from order to delivery across Europe
Ordered an XSPC RX120 radiator, but they sent me an EX120 instead. Shit happens, I guess. Everything except that little snafu has been excellent with fast replies from customer service (first reply took a few hours, but later replies only took minutes). No problem cancelling my order (I thought specialtech was out of stock so I ordered from another company), and they of course apologized for sending me the wrong item. Good prices as well.
If you need a pen och a refill to a pen, you must check out Cult pens on the internet, they are awsome. Even to a little country named sweden.
If you want the highest quality products (and why wouldn't you!) then the Maxishop is the only place. Subscribe to their news letter and get all the best deals!
My best 4 weeks of my life!!! I wouldn't change it for nothing. The people and the school! It was a tuff education and you had to study hard but it was totally worth it. I stayed and worked for two months, not so good pay but a very good experience!! Hughs and Kisses to my friends!!
I Did my course in Phuket and it was really awesome:). I met so many crazy and funny people and made friends for life! But the education was tuff so be ready to study! I stayed in Thailand and worked for two months after. Not so much pay but so much fun!! Tumbs up for EBS!! XXX
I placed the two orders and payed in full in April 2012, 22531 SEK. In December they finally agreed that they will not deliver anything. Only after contacting a legal adviser at Konsument Europa / ECC Sweden, INFURN returned the full payment in April 2013. I consider the company to be nothing but fraudulent.
I´d like always to travel  with  Mr. Jet , good prices , good information, good and speed service ,
Everything you could want in an online store - easy to find products, clearly described. Personal, friendly quick service via email. Fast delivery and good freebies!
The company is very wired. They used DHL, every expensive courier, to ship but they are unwilling to buy packing boxes. I received my items packed simply in a plastic bag! All the items are damaged to some extent. None of them are suitable for gifts. The most frustrating shopping experience in my life!! I contacted them via email, no response at one week at all. No customer service phone number is provided on their website! Disappointed that Trustpilot does not allow to give a 0 star rating. If yes, I would definitely give 0 star for this company!
By far the best site for buying surf appropriate swimwear and fun colourful surf brand clothing. Just made my first order, and can't wait for it to get here. Hope I will be as happy then... ;)
The purchase was very easy and they had awfully many payment options that made it very flexible for all of us to be able to shop there. Unlike most sites , emporiolive provide so much , not to mention they were the cheapest out there. - Literally , two very popular and top known sites in Sweden that generates a list of all web shops available in europe for cheapest cell phones or similar devices , emporiolive appeared as rank one. Everything went instantly , the payment , them sending the item , and a mail from them about the 2 year warrant of the device I ordered. It was great , I will definitely shop from them again. Their customer service was ridiculously easy to reach. They even had this live chat on their site that I use to contact them with , apart from mailings , and it was as instant as a chat supposed to be.
I have buy a lot from Trekkinn. Normaly they got all equipment and clothes that I need, and deliverance time normaly is very good. Some time it takes a bit longer time. But I have always got wha II have ordered. And always to a very good prices.
Good pricing, most items in stock. Got contacted after placing order that few parts where not in stock with recommendation for alternative parts which was very good. Items where not dispatched for a week due to miss in the change in the order. Once I sent a reminder the order was shipped very quickly and arrived at my door 2 days later. Good and responsive customer support. I will buy more stuff from Design911!
BeautyBay has all my favourite products and it's really easy to find everything on the website. My only complaint is that delivery takes a Little too long but as I live in Sweden, I guess that is expected. Otherwise, I love BeautyBay, great prices and all the good stuff!!
I live in Helsinki, but use humlegården because, incl. the shipment price it is just about the same as buying the things locally, and the selection is much better.
Finally found stylish & sexy board shorts, warming up for beach 2014!
This was my first experience purchasing from Wallpaper direct and I am very happy with the outcom. The wallpaper even arrived before scheduled; today Wednesday instead of Friday.  /Per
Ända minus var leveranstiden ...... tog en vecka fast jag tog via UPS
tend to be cautious when it comes to shop over the net. but Golfstore europé  has never disappointed me. Good service and prices.
The bag is perfect quality and came shipped in a good package, delivered by the door. But I had to wait almost two months after I had placed the order. Luckily it was during the winter season.
Customer support was very helpful. Shoes arrived quicker than I thought (perhaps three of four working days) since I live in Sweden.
I really love beautybay! I have been a customer for a couple of years now and i never had any problems.
Items was delivered after two days to Sweden. No problems and very good quality products.
I  ordered a jacket that was 175 euros cheaper than any other webshop and it arrived after only a couple of days.
Edit: On January 25th 2012 I received two pieces of the beanbag, the kids loves them and the colour of it. Off course I am still a bit angry over the late delivery and the lack of good information from them. But at least I can now confirm that they do deliver your order. I wish Infurn and all their clients all the best and hope that all clients receive their furniture asap. /helena Hi, Ordered two Beanbags from Infurn.com at September 23, have been in contact with them several times to get a delivery date. They have said tomorrow, today, in two weeks, before christmas etc etc but no Beanbags have been delivered yet. These where supposed to be Christmas presents for my kids, ordered way before Christmas :( Right know I am trying to cancel my orders and get my money back. Have tried to call them but they never answer theur phone either :( I would not recommend anyone to buy anything from this company!!
First I feel fear for shopping in internet  since I am disappointing with many online websites before, but with Amazon I can tell that they will never make you disappointing since they have very good service and teamwork. Really nice thanks to make me feel something like this, Amazon makes me think that it still has good online website in this world too . ^^
Happy with their service. . . .although sometime it takes time a bit to get the answers but it is good anyway. Thanks !!!!!
** EDIT ** Must say that I am very pleasantly surprised. Cartrawler repaid me today 100 euros to me as compensation. Good work! I never thought they would do it, but they kept their promises. /Zoran ************************************************************************************* I rented the car in Belgrade between 19/04/2014 - 26/04/2014 I picked up the car at 23 at night because the aircraft landed at 22:30. I I had to pay 38 euro extra because I picked the car "late at night". I had booked a large Toyota Avensis because I had two large suitcases and a stroller, but got a little car Chevrolet Cruze which meant that we went very uncomfortable with a bag on the back seat. In the back seat sat even my daughter and her little baby. No, I am not happy at all with this and will never rent a car from them.
ett bra företag med bra service och bra bemötande som hjälper till om man har problem!
This is a bunch of amateurs. They say it is free shipping, but in the end it will cost you more than shipping costs. We ordered about 20 items for 350 USD but they send the goods in separate packages which means that the customer must pay the administration fee to UPS for each package. For the first package we had to pay 10 USD in taxes and 30 USD in administration fee. The value of the items in this package was 35 USD. I guess we will receive about 5-8 separate packages more. We have already said no to the next package. The problem is that we have already paid the total of 350 USD. And they have not answered us when we wanted a refund. Please be advised that the cost for your items will be at least the double in the end.
I ordered a Pink Plant mix and a bottle of Rose wine for a friend haveing a birthday. Orer was placed 2 days in front. No delevery and I couldent get in contact. No responce on emails in several days. Finally the order was delivered - 6 days after. But it was pink and white flowers and white wine. I will never use euroflorist any more! I am very dissapointed
I ordered on Tuesday and within a few hours I got a mail saying that the items were sent the same day. On Friday they arrived - in Sweden! Online shopping at its best :)
Received my earrings today and am very happy. They are really nice. You  have very helpful customer service. Will definite shopping with you more things
It was my first time to order photo goods on-line, so I had some doubts. But I was very satisfied with the result and of course will continue to order from PhotoBox. Highly recommend!
I have bought beauty products and perfume twice from allbeauty.com now.  The big range of products, the labels, the prices and fast shipping makes me totally happy. I will be a regular costumer and I recommend this company to all my girlfriends!
Found the sweatshirt I was looking for here - coould not find it online in Sweden
My son aged 15 ordered items to be shipped to Sweden for about 150 USD. Only items for 50 USD were shipped, the rest was on waiting list. And waiting was what he did for 3 months and no more items. He then e-mailed SkateAmerica and got ballony answers 3 times then they didn´t answer any more and no items were shipped after 6 months! No money in return and no answers on e-mail. He then called and talked to somebody who promised to return his 100 USD but no money arrived. He then called again, another promise and still no money. If I would have lived in the USA I would have sued them but now I wrote to the US embassy in Stockholm and they had got several complaints of SkateAmerica and were considering legal actions back home. My son is very dissappointed and now much less impressed of USA, a statement I am prepared to agree to... My son has still not got his 100 USD in return one year after the initial order.
It´s very easy to find the product you want on the website. The delivery was quicker than promised, although I chose the free alternative.
Due to a confusing item description, I ordered an item that did not fit my equipment. Return of the item was hassle free.
i am very satisfied whith clothes and the service to sweden. so fast and safe delivery. thank you...
Everything was perfect and fine with the order! Only downside i have is it took 2 weeks for the order to arrive.
I found that Framesdirect fulfilled all my expectations when it came to delivery of my order. Quick response and fast delivery despite it was an international order.
I am however, disappointed that Robinsons squash with the taste of cherries doesn´t exist in your storige! Hope it still exists at all since it is one of my abolute favourites! Other than that I am very satisfied wih everythin from the tea to the delivirence! Sincerly, Annika Larsson
DHL takes the shipping down a little, My order om sunday, and the package i My city first next tuesday, last year was the order finished on just 4 days.
I ordered a North Face jacket at 30% lower price. The jacket was not in stock, but it only took 5 days to get it in place. Delivery was super easy with DHL delivering at my door. Perfect!
Bought a Stormtrooper costume which fitted quite well and looked all right, just about what I had expected. The website could use a few tune-ins for categorization purposes, otherwise it was easy and lots to choose from.
Ordered flowers to be delivered at one friday, the flowers couldn't be delivered and it seemed liked the florist just gave up after one try. Nothing happended until I contacted them and asked what was going on, two days later the flowers where finally delivered. I wonder where the serviceminded thinking went..?
Had incredibly fast delivery to Sweden Kiruna, only 4 days until it was outside my house. Ordered on monday a snowboard and had it on friday! Very fast answers thru email also. A+
As the headline says. Great choice and prices but even though I knew the delivery was 5 to 8 days, it was a very long wait. The shoes came on the 8th day. I think I'll find somewhere that freights from my country next time. If I find as good prices. ;)
Got the navigator I'd ordered within reasonable time but there' nothing remarkable about that. I haven' needed to deal swith customer service so I can't say anything more.
The experience of travelling with them has always been inferior but now their prices including hidden charges seldom comes much under competitors.
Totally the best and cheapest place on the net to buy games from! Always buys my games from there. Very cheap shipping as well even though they ship it from the us. Sure may take some extra time, but it's not their fault. Have recommended this site for several of my friends as well, i'm just that happy with it!
Ordered two Fatboy XXL on a Sunday. Reciewed them at Friday the week after. The price, quality and service has been awesome! We have seen the same beanbags in a store for 4 times the price!
They're ok if plasticky and the insole sticks to bare feet and come out when you kick them off. The French original is a superior product in every way and cheaper but I could not find it on-line.
Super fast shipping to Sweden and answered fast on all of my questions and they give me super service, i will bay from them again
I've got only good things to say about this Madhouse!
It's the best support I have ever received from any company!
They processed the order quickly and the package was delivered in few days. Good and informative homepage.
I really like the range of brands. Super fast delivery (to Sweden) and I really like that you can chat with their friendly and helpful customer service. I will back for sure!
When i recieved my package, it was missing one item. I just wrote to the customer service and told them, and they simply just shipped away the missing item right away. Thank you wiggle
I orderd flowers for my wifes birthday as a surprise. Aprox at 18.00 at the day of the agreed delivery, the florist called my wife and asked if it was ok that they delivered the flowers the following day. The surprise was spoiled!! I had left my phone nr. when i orderd the flowers, so why not call me??? the positive thing about this experince is when i called the customer service the next day, to complain and cancle the flowers, they were wery polite, and said they were sorry and gave me a full refund, no questions asked. But i´m sorry to say, that i will choose another florist the next time i plan to send flowers.
Never ever have i tried such poor services or customerservice. No response on complaints No fixes on issues, which is clearly a Telia problem. Inkasso service even though bills are paid! So stay clear of Telia if you want quality service and a customer service who cares. Personally i can recommend [Link] which seems to understand what customerservice is all about. Sorry for my english but since Telia does not understand what i'm telling them in Danish, there might be someone there educated in a more common foreign language. Telia - come on - it is not that hard! PS. I had to give them ONE star... They deserve ZERO!
Like most people I ordered long before Christmas. Still have not seen my goods. When I do get an answer, very seldom, I always got told "will be shipped Tuesday" or whatever. On their homepage for my delivery it states "will be delivered week starting with February 10, 2012"  Today it is March 14. Still no sign - by the way - who starts a week at a Friday. I guess Infurn togehter with Groupon pulled of a giant scam!
... as the headline says, and my camcorder Panasonic WA-30 works just fine again :-)
I´m so satisfied with my sofa. The company was very proffessionally and delivered in time for us in Sweden. I bought a fourseater Chesterfield .
I would recommend all beauty to all the beautiful  girls who like beauty.
Ordered a week ago. Was delivered to me this morning just as it said. Would have wished that they would try to exceed my expectations by delivering faster. The clothes are really nice!
Good prices, nice that they're offering free shipping to Sweden so that we too can enjoy the site with their low prices. My order arrived kind of quickly and was well packaged.
I was impressed from the beginning by your diverse and excellent assortment. Have ordered mostly clothing, bike parts and spares. The service have been fine and the prices use to be attractive, too. Only thing a bit negative is that it often takes longer or much longer than stated when ordering something to the day I finally get it.
Just looking at the necklaces (both) gives me chills, wearing them gives me even more chills! I love that there's a history/lore about Glittergoth items. It gives an additional dimension. Drakul's mirror fits me perfectly, both size an style. The lore of the forest is a Christmas gift to a friend. I'm impressed by your fast delivery and that even international shipping is free. Usual international shipping costs regardless of the purchase sum. Thank You!
They are very reliable, active customer service, good products and very secure payment in your own convenience. Thats what business ia about. Thanks to them and will always continue to shop and recommend them to my friends and family.
They have great products, great range and can deliver quickly. In addition, their staff very understanding and helpful. What more could you ask for! I have ordered a number of times and will continue to do so. I represent a motorcycle club in Sweden and we have benefited greatly from the products we have ordered here.
The patterns Stof2000 offers are nice! Everything made me pleased, would be even better if the costs for delivery to Sweden were lower 😊
very god and easy and very helpful shopping experience. Iam happy
I always check reviews of companies and products before I make a purchase, unless I've seen or used the products first hand. Trustpilot has helped me avoid poor companies and choose good ones. I think this service is great and I hope as many as possible fill in honest reviews as it helps both us as consumers in choosing companies and products. And it also helps companies improve their service and know what they're doing correct.
Second time I purchase something from Winstanleys. First time it took us 5 working days to get a stroller sent to Sweden. Freight cost was cheaper than mainland Swedish resellers and price was about 300 GBP cheaper than Swedish sites and/or stores. This time it was a car seat for a 3-year old. In just a few days it was delivered and once again very quickly and cheap. I've recommended Winstanleys to everybody asking me about where to but kids stuff. A very satisfied customer from Stockholm Sweden.
Very good service and approach from my contact Peter , and a great deal with a good price and fast information along the way , via mailcontact to me in Sweden ! You're the best ! // Best Regards , Magnus
I have shopped here several times, never been disappointed, you really should try this site
And they even give you the chance to pay over several months with no ekstra charge... i mean how great is that :-) So thats why the high score
Ha what to say about google other then this is the only search engine to use if you wanna find the right thing right away... I was actually just on a company day visiting Microsoft the other day, and they said that Bing was the best search engine on the market and 15 people just bursted in to laughter... Keep up the good work Google
I have an Iphone 3GS and a Ipad2 and both of them have given me several hours of joy, even now I write this from my Ipad... But to be frank the iphone 3GS has a very bad microphone compared to other mobiles... And offcourse it would have been nice with flash on the ipad... But both are still great products
Have ordered through komplett.se a couple of times and actually many time through komplett.dk and they have the best service I have encounted so far when we are talking about hardware for computers
Not that much to say actually, they deliver great speed 100/100mbit and with only very little downtime... One evening in 2 years...
I tried viasatondemand here in Malmø, and eventhough I have a 100/100mbit internet connection I could not load any of their movies and the soccer matches that I tried to watch was lagging and being several minutes behind the real match, and their method to catch up was fastforwarding through the match... And if that was not enough, when I tried to quit the subscription by written form they acted as though they had never gotten it, so 2 times they charged me for an ekstra month eventhough i did not use their service!! So dont use their service they just want your money!!!
I looked for a left hand side skirt to our 993 Turbo and was really pleased to find it at Design911 at a competitive price including freight to Sweden. Next time I need a spare part I will definitely check Design911!
Fast delivery och god item.  A lot of more thing and much cheaper than I i can found in Sweeden.
I ordered a small item with shipping to Sweden and with shipping included it was way cheaper than all other stores that I checked. However, due to some mistake in the packing process I received another version of the item. I emailed customer service and only a few hours later I got a reply that they are sending me the correct item. Some days later it arrived and everything was in order. Mistakes happen and this one was corrected quickly so I am fully satisfied!
The only downside is a telephone check imo, otherwise fast and painless. Can recommend.
Please save your time and money - they never send you anything nor refund if you cancel your order.
Placed my order and was delivered in just a few days. Had to return a pair of shoes too small in size. Too Long time to wait on refund (20 days) otherwise very satisfied.
I searched for a good companie to tune my car, and find Quantumtuning. They are very nice to do business with, nice people, and they know what they doing. The car is a V50, and it's a new car after remapping! So if you are thinking to remap your car, go to Quantumtuning! You will not change your mind!
Instead of  the Adidas Sprint Web SHORT Thight i ordered and have a mailed confirmation about I have recieved and returned two pairs of LONG thight. As you all understand this has cost me a great deal of irritation and some job. Wiggle insist on that I return the wrongly sent goods first and when they recive it they send out the new pair. That have resulted in a long time of waiting! and i haven't yet recieved the correct item. The shoes I ordered at the same time they were "unable to supply" (ok, s***t happens) In the same email they wrote "We aim to despatch a new item to you in 2-7 days, providing our supplier still has stock available. Otherwise we will contact you again with a revised despatch date". They never contacted me. I hade to ask about it a few weak after and then got the answer "I was not aware that you required an update on these". That made me mad. When I first tried to contact the Wiggle Customer Services i got an outo response "due to crucial system maintenance work this weekend there will be a delay with reply to your email but we aim to reply within 48 hours".  After that I must say that the customer service have been helpful but they haven't offered any kind of conpensation. I have made one other order at Wiggle.com and if I would review that order I would give them 4-5 stars but it's when thing go bad the company is put to test /Daniel
Very quick and helpful when i mailed them. I even got pictures to show the answers on my questions.
I am super pleased. I have ordered on a numerous occasions. Quick and cheap delivery, even though I am living in Sweden. Super happy with the products as well.
I am really pleased! I have ordered several times, and the delivery time is just a day or two, and I love the great quality of the clothes.
The product was damaged upon arrival. This was not shipping damage, the gloves must have been damaged before it was in the bag. It was very thin gloves that came in a bubble wrapped bag, the seam was damaged and the gloves had several holes in them.
I'm really satisfied with the website, and the product range is great, so are the prices! I didn't choose the trackable delivery because I thought it was too expensive. I got to wait for a while but it was totally worth it! I think it would be great to be able to track all orders though.
I ordered some samplers of blades and a nose hair trimmer. All arrived as expected. Ordered from europe and the delivery was fast.
I am totally satisfied with both the product, my wonderful shoes, and with the delivery. I can recommend this online shopping!
They have super good quallity on their products, fast delivery and very good prices. My new place to do cool and beautiful thing with my photos!!
Just as the title says the store is good with low prices but the shipping costs are high. The packaging of the product was good but still the side of the watch carton got a bump and was dented, don't know if it was caused in shipping or if it was there before packaging.
Golfonline have a great site. Lots of variety, great prices and very quick to deliver even though I live in Sweden. I always use them.
Packaging was damaged upon receipt causing some of the content (powder) to have fallen out, not really the mistake of Bulkpowders but unfortunate nevertheless.
A reliable company. Easy to order, pay and got the delivery a week later sent to my house in Sweden.
it would have got five stars if I had tried to re:send something but I have had to do that yet cause everything I have ordered has fitted me. an extra plus for there fast delivering, even if Im living in sweden sometimes its get faster when I order from wiggle then from any swedish site.
It's easy to find the parts your looking for and they got everything I needed for my bike.
Leaves nothing to wish for. Good price, fair shipping costs (to Sweden in my case), great products as well as quick, helpful and polite customer service. The next time I probably won't have to spend as much time comparing vendors.
I really enjoyed shopping here! Really nice jackets, that you can't find in Sweden, and for a good price too. Great online chat support and fast delivery - I would gladly recommend this site to a friend!
I am so please with the service from the lovely  and friendly staff. The jacket was nice and fitted me perfect! I will recommend this shop to all my friends and will come back next time I need nice cloths!!! Thank you Country Attire Ltd
The first line sums it all up, hopefully my cat is now free from worms! :)
All my opinions is based on my experience. Ok, here is my story. I've ordered costum fitted clubs then 25th of May and It took 4 weeks to get them shipped and another 1 week for the delivery. They say aprox. 2 weeks to get the clubs fitted so it was twice that time. I just don't get why they don't do something about the problems of the delivery-time. I dont care if I have to wait 4 weeks for My stuff, I would still have ordered, just give me a deliverydate that is Close to the truth. And the support, come on guys, dont have a phone-number if no one never answer, and up to two days for answer a mail, come on..! The worst thing was that you reported My first review here as a wasn't a costumer even though I had My ordernumber in My review. Thats not how to treat yous costumer. Take all the critisism here on the site and make it to something good instead of argue against all the costumers then you have a good chance of beeing one of the top sellers on the internet.... Cons: Promised deliverytimes is not accurate Support on the Phone does not excist, mail so and so.. Pros: The options you have when making a costum fitted club is amazing The prices are Greta, maybe cheapest online . Summary: Will I order from golfstore again? If I have the time to wait for My merchandise and there no hurry them I would order because of the pros, but if I need something in a rush or for a birthdaygift then I would hesitate. Dear Golfstoreeurope.com, listen to your costumers and you Will be the number 1 golfstore out there. Remember, without us, no golfstoreeurope.com Best Regards David
When booking a flight JIB-ADD with the exact same booking details as two other bookings CPH-JIB - Ticket.dk - just cancelled the booking with claim of possible fraud - instead of contacting on phone and/or email. When contacting on phone we received a lot of crab information from agent. No excuse or no suggestion of solving the issue. We went online on a competitor and bought the same ticket with same booking details but without any problems. The service of Ticket in this situation is beyond belief and totally unacceptable. We will deffinately not use Ticket.dk again - ever.
GOOD service and A can recommend it for you. Thats good company and there is immedelity service. The bad thing are the postalservise company in some of there company.
I am very happy with JK and have placed 10+ orders with them during the past couple of years. Excellent web shop, decent prices, not too expensive shipping and very quick delivery (I live in Sweden and Swedish companies often take longer to ship). The only thing I lack is to have a wider selection of repair panels for my buses - they have so much rust...
I ordered a lamp from Voga and when ordering the indication of delivery was 2-4 weeks. The delivery cannot be tracked online in any way so I actually started wondering whether it would arrive but was contacted by the transport company 3,5 weeks after the order and they agreed a delivery date for me. They were flexible on timing so that was good and the delivery was made within the agreed upon time slot. A bit disappointed that the delivery guy dumped the pallet (after goods have been put in elevator) the delivery came with on the side walk - not really proper way of acting but was easy for me to remove it. The product had good instructions and appeared well packaged. Up to this point I was fairly pleased with the purchase (like a 3 out of 5). When I however opened the package I could see that one of the pieces (the lamp shade) was scratched on the insde. I took a picture and e-mailed Voga. I promptly received a response with detailed instructions on what I needed to send (several pictures of the product, packaging, labels under product, product in full size etc.) I fully complied and sent the e-mail and was promised a solution within 10 working days. after 11 working days I contacted them again and just received a message that it take 10 working days to handle my case - when pointing out that it was already past that time no response was given. So I am now more than 3 weeks after filing complaint and I have received no real feedback other than that they will get back to me. Service appears to be extremely poor and I am doubtful they have any intention of ever handling things. Responses given appear to be totally disconnected from what is actually asked so sometimes one wonders if it is automated responses. After writing this review (not sure if connected or if they just got to my case at customer service) I was contacted by a veru service minded woman from their customer service who offered a solution that exceeded my expectation of what they would offer. They took a real customer oriented approach and came up with something that made me feel that they took my experience seriously. After that they also followed up to see if everything was handled to my satisfication. They actually managed to turn what was a poor experience into something that is actually very good and I would now not hesitate to shop here again. If I had issues when shopping again I would also most likely call them as well as sending an e-mail as things were solved quicker by phone.
After an order with mediocre quality (I think I was in bad luck) MyP is back on track. Fast delivery and good quality protein. The wife did not like my natural non-flavoured procetin so she made me order the chocolate mint and the banana. A bit to artificial for my taste buds... But she loves them. I'm fine with my own protein shakes.
The delivery took some time, but that was expected from the beginning since Eclipse was very clear with the process from the beginning. Unbeatable value for money -great(and really good looking as wall as comfortable) goods overall.
I've discovered this site by watching makeup tutorials in youtube. This site was actually introduced by one of the most beautiful women on Earth ( Chloe Morello ). And since then, i've been totally in love and very satisfied costumer with both the amazingly high quality mineral makeup products that this site has and the service or help that's been offered to me by the owners/manegers. They have very huge range of high quality mineral makeup as like starter kits, foundations , primers, eyeliners, mascaras, lipglosses, u name it and ofcourse lots more. I've ordered twice from this site cuz the prices are great & the service is even better. Will deffinitely recommend this site to all makeup lovers. I really wished that they could open a shop here in Sweden ( Stockholm ) where i live . :D :D :D Zuzu
I have been searching for a website where i can buy Max Factor Earth Spirit Eyeshadows (cheap priced) & makeupsmadness made my dream come true. & ofcourse it didn't only end up by buying the eyeshadows, well it ended up by placing an order of around 30 products!!! So in love with their products. Great products, huge range of everything. Fast & cheap shipping to Sweden & the packaging  was 5 stars. Couldn't be better. I love this site & totally recommend it to everybody.
You should try this,always the prettiest flowers and the fastest delivery!
Very good prices. Unfortunately my last booking went wrong. I asked for a single room and I found out later that I was booked in a double room and it was not possible to change. Partially my misstake. I should have looked more carefully. I have earlier booked through Otel.com without any problems. Probably that was the reason for not double checking. I still do not know what went wrong.
I made an order of five items on June 26. For some reason, the order was divided into two separate packages with four bottles in one package and the fifth bottle in another. The two packages were dispatched at the same time. The first package arrived after a few days but I am still waiting for the second one with the last bottle. Obviously, I tried to contact customer service to inform them about the missing package. There was only one problem; no e-mail address to be found anywhere on their website. Via the FAQ section I was referred to click on the specific order once I had logged in, but my orders were not displayed so nowhere to click. Since I live in Sweden and would like to avoid expensive international phone calls, I sent an e-mail to the only address I eventually managed to find, that is customer relations. No response so far. Ironicly, I did get an e-mail from Look fantastic a few days ago, which was a request to comment on my puchase in another forum. I was informed to contact them directly if there were delivery problems which I had already done without success. I have ordered from Look Fantastic a few times before and I used to be satisfied with their services. However, if I'm not able to get in contact with them this time to sort out the delivery problem, this was the last time I did my shopping at Look Fantastic. ***** After posting this review I came in contact with customer service and received a very good response. They are investigating the issue, a replacement will be sent and the message centre (through which e-mails can be sent) was described. I have no idea why I didn't manage to find this information in the first place but it may be that Look fantastic have updated their website after my first attempt to find e-mail contact information. It doesn't matter. From now on it is clear how to get in contact with them and I am satisfied with their response. When I receive the replacement item I will update this review to five stars. ***** My second package has arrived - about three and a half weeks later than the first one although they were sent on the same date. It is very strange that the first package was delivered promptly after a few working days while the other took 23 working days, but I have at least finally received everything in my order. I was promised a replacement delivery which had still not been sent five days later. Since I did receive the original package, I informed customer service that the replacement was no longer needed. Therefore, I will never know whether they would have actually sent it or not which is why I leave this review with a four star rating after all.
One year ago I started a subscription. I am not watching Swedish TV so much, but if I want to see it, I want HD. I have to say: until now everything went okay. But the best way to test the quality of a firm os when you start to have problems. Well, I have now. Suddenly no signal at all anymore! When I started the subscription. they were so fast. But now: "We have now booked an technician who will contact you within 10 days." So it can take some weeks before I have Swedish TV back? This is really a very bad service! I am happy that I am not dependent of Canal Digital to watch the world final and the Tour de France. Because I also have canaldigitaal.nl .
We work already many years with BitDefender. A good prodcut! But.... They use Avangate as the company to send the bills etc. That company sucks! They have (together with BitDefender) a tricky way of "automatic-renewals". And if they take by mistake the wrong amount from your creditcard, they say that they can't help you: they say contact BitDefender. Not correct of course, because Avangate takes the money. But okay, it wouldn't be so bad, if BitDefender really HELPED in that situation. But they don't do that. They are sure that the customer made a mistake without taking the time to check what went wrong . So: it's a nice product, but when my subscription is expired, I will move to another product.
I ordered a replace battery for my Sony-Ericsson phone. The battery works great and it was delivered in time. I only didn't notice that the product came from the other side of the world. My question about the "late" reply (sorry, my fault) was answered very fast. So for me: the next time I need a battery, I will use BatteryUpgrade again!
Very quick service, even though I was in Sweden and ordered it took only 4days from click to opening the packet. Nice work.
Battery Champion is a new favorite! They have all kinds of stuff to buy to a lautable price. High standard and a serious company with high quality. I am very contented.
I really like this company!  A wide range of payment alternatives and a very simple to understand ordering procedure. Waiting few days extra for the laptop battery shipped directly from HongKong was a little effort compared to getting a new battery for less than half the price if I had bought from a lokal dealer.
I purchased a professional job application and personal statement writing package from CVKnowhow. Before doing so I contacted the company to verify that they had experience of writing applications for individuals within my profession (Teaching.) What I received was of exceptionally poor quality. It had the following problems: The same paragraph appeared more than once within the personal statement; There was complete ommision of my job history from the application form; Incorrect information was provided in the application form; There were multiple formatting, spelling and grammatical errors, it seemed to have been written with a lack of awareness of the skills required within my industry. In short, it was abysmal. I emailed CVKnowhow (using every contact email address I had for the company) to ask them to fix the problems or to send a refund, but I received no reply, I have since emailed 2 more times and I still haven't recieved a reply. When I later tried to contact them by the customer complaints email address listed on the website, I found that the email address was not functional. An appalling experience, not at all what I would expect from a professional writing company and I certainly wouldn't recommend them to others. I have since reported them to Action Fraud, a division of the UK police which deals with internet crime, on the grounds that the product they provided was not as described and was of very poor quality. I would encourage anyone else experiencing problems with this company to do the same.
I ordered a pocket hole jig. Was delivered to Sweden the same week. The order status page was a bit misleading but a quick response from customer service cleared that up.
I ordered a table at the end of September with a 15-18 week delivery time. I have repeatedly contacted INFURN and received nothing but excuses and later delivery dates. Yesterday they moved the date up again until the middle of April. I have no faith in this company whatsoever. I have asked for my money back and they have refused. They have not delivered what they said they would: a table within 18 weeks. They are not willing to reimburse me for their repeated delays. This is not a company I will ever be doing business with again. I have contacted the Swedish Consumer's Ministry to try and get this company blacklisted for fraudulantly claiming to deliver within 18 weeks. I have also contacted the General Reclaimation Board to try and get my money back. I hope this review helps somebody not make the same mistake I did.
I had problems whit shipment to Sweden but they solved that issue in a very god manner. Happy customer and I will return. Rolf
First webshop with the new Colmar spring Collection available early at season. Fast reply on any questions by email. No shippingcosts, even if needed to replace your order to a different size!  I would recommend this Company to anyone!!
After years of problems with finding a good shampoo, a friend asked me if I checked on BeautyBay (which I hadn't). So I checked on your webpage and almost immediately found what I was looking for - Nioxin :) Therefore BeautyBay is my webshop in shining armour. There were no problems with ordering, payment or delivery. I'm absolutely shopping here again and recommend you to friends and family.
I ordered a rare phone (dual-SIM) that wasn't available anywhere else in Sweden. It was delivered exactly one week later, well within the promised delivery time. I got an additional invoice for Swedish customs fees, but a quick email to support solved this problem and the money covering the fees was put back into my account within two days. Even though this company looks new in the Swedish market, they gave good, fast service and acted trustworthly, especially regarding the extra customs fee, that was randomly added.
Our contact with pramworld (and in particular Emma Jane!) was amazing, I have actually never in my life experienced such service (online or IRL). I have nothing but great things to say about Pramworld!
best and cheapest shop if you want to buy top-products from abroad - free shipping and excellent service! I do not buy anything in Sweden anymore as I can get everything from BeautyBay much cheaper!!!
I purchased my weddingdress from Psbridal and I am more than satisfied. My dress arrived faster than expected and it was beautiful. Thank you!
After 10 days with no status change of my order i contacted their support with a e-mail and mentiend my order number and asked what was wrong, but still 5 days later i have not got any respond from myprotein. I then called them and they did find out that a couple of samples i had ordered was out of stock, the samples should now be canceld so the rest of the order should be shipped now. They seem to have a glitch between website stock and real stock, and no system to contact customer with update that a orered product is out of stock.
I have bought different cosmetic  items from beautybay . I consider it as a all-in-one shop to find solutions for different cosmetic problems in daily life. It works very fast with the shipping and delivery. I never had any problems since I started using it and now it's almost 3 years now. Based on my experience so far, I can recommend this to anyone who wish to buy beauty items without spending much time or money. I enjoy this smart shopping!
Rate was good, car was there and easy to pick up and return.  Only thing that was wrong was the brand, was expecting something from the General's factories, but got a terrible VAG-product.
Very good prices comapared to Sweden. Qiuck delivery and almost no delivery cost. Always buy my dermalogica products from ZestBeaty now! But...I do not understand how to use my beauty points. I have lots of them but it never seems to be possible.
I really like that you have small icon look like a cofee cup when breakfast is included to the price. The presentation and overview is easy to understand.
I tried to use a bonus code on jack&jones site. The purchase went through as normal. Over 24 hours later I got an email saying my order was rejected. Why did it take over 24 hours? When I emailed bestseller asking why they did not have an answer except to make sure I was using a swedish credit card. I was using a swedish visa and it is fully funded. I ordered from boost.se instead.
Ordered some t-shirts and the quality is outstanding. Very nice and the fit is very good. A medium is actually a medium so no need to buy a size up or down.
I have done a few orders from beautybay and I am so satisfied! Fast delivery and very good prices! I will always order my beauty supplies from beautybay! Five stars isn't enough!! Thank you so much beautybay for being the best webshop!
We rented a car to attend a wedding in Birmingham for 4 days. The car had no gasoline in tank, so we had to fill it up. What was left in the tank when we delivered it was not refunded, company policy. The rate on the internet which we signed off for was about 40 pounds, but at the airport it was suddenly 75 pounds. They also wanted 1.000 pounds in deposit not to draw any additional fees. When we came back they found a scratch on the car, which we had not seen. They said it would be another 80 pounds + tax. When I asked to receive a receipt upon the repair they said they did not repair them before at the end of use. Our third party for which we paid another 30 pounds insurance did not cover this at it starts at 100 pounds and above. So, instead of having to pay 40 pounds we paid 185 pounds for 4 days. To make it all look human/good for the planet they call the company green motion, even though our car just run on normal diesel like the cars you can get anywhere else.
So happy with Country-Attires web-shop and deliveries! I've used them now for 2 years, and are always happy. They have the best prices and free delivery too :-) I ordered my boots tuesday, and on friday I had them delivered (and I live in Sweden!). I highly recommend this seller to everybody!
...the delivery time takes way to long. Should not take 22 days to get 4 products sent to Sweden.
Good price and all, but to have to wait like 8 hours to get the code seemed a little to much compared to other stores online. But still a good site worth buying from.
I ordered two sweaters and a scarf from Smith and Morris in Britain, and I got what i ordered within a week delivered to Sweden. Their competitive prices and excellent selections, coupled with great delivery options make Smith and Morris my go-to store for clothes that are hard to find in Sweden.
I ordered a Barbour Sapper Olive jacket and it came exactly as advertised. I placed the order from Sweden, so it took some time, however it was well worth the wait.
Ordered a wine cooler with 3 days estimated  delivery. After two weeks mailed them to ask why no delivery. No response. Tried to cancel the order. No response. Demanded a refund. No response. All you get is an e-ticket and when you check it, it is cancelled without a comment. After another two weeks the cooler arrived, and it was sent after my cancellation.
I found out about boohoo.com at a swedish blog that I follow. I myself also live in Sweden and I just started to order from other countries. What i first liked about boohoo.com is that they have so much of everything! I love knitsweaters and I came to heaven! So many colors to choose from and the price! So cheep but still very good quality! It takes about 1 week to get the stuff to Sweden. Im really happy with this website and I will shop here alot.
I love Spartoo. They have so many different brands. I have been a VIP for almost a year now (I order from them ever month) and it only takes about 3-5 days to get my things and they always look like in the pictures. The prizes are amazing and I couldn't be more happy.
Good supportive clerk who guides to find the perfect furniture which fits your needs.
Finding the rental offices was first problem. No one to meet us and no signs and none of other rental companies knew (or would tell) where it was. No one answered the phone when we called. Had to call Rental cars three times for help. Waited for nearly an hour for before their shuttlebus found us. Offices are so close we could have walked if we knew. Handover staff was friendly and helpful so we left with good impression. The car was not in top condition with a lot of noise from the rear axle making long journey unpleasant. Return was very quick and even drove us to the hotel nearby. Overall mixed impression but would be willing to try rental company again.
World Remit is without any doubt the easiest, safest and fastest way to send money. Before i found them me and my family used our regular banks and visa cards to send money between Sweden and Philippines. This came with at lot of fees and the need to visit an ATM (wich they didn't have nearby...). World Remit plays in another leauge than their competitors, such as western union. No need to fill in complicated papers, no need to visit an office, fast and easy in the comfort of your own home! (And no, I don't work there or get paid from them - I just really think they are this good!)
Everything was great with ordering and receiving (5 wd to Stockholm), but unfortunately the Ray-Ban Carbon tech was to small for my head, and that isn´t the Sunglasses-shop to blame. My best recommendation to the web-shop!
On top of keeping an excellent selection of clothing, through one of the most user friendly web stores I've visited, the people behind are east to get in touch with and are incredibly service minded.
Amazing service and so nice people that are working there! One of my absolute favourit shop and I return again and again :)
Very impressed with prices, selection of models and Customer Service. Only improvement suggestion is to improve collaboration with couriers to be able the to provide info of delivery status.
Easy to order, fast shipment and the gear was like the description on the web. No problem what so ever.
Studying full-time at University while working a part-time job doesn't allow me to visit a bodyshop in town, so ordering online has been a great relief. The products came just a few days after I ordered and it was a safe pain-free transaction. But first and foremost the products I have tried at bodyshop.dk has been effective and really helped me in my workout, I highly recommend this service!
I was buying 3 products from beautybay but when I get my package there was one item missing. I contact the support and after several  days i get an very roud answer that they hade cont there storage and that there was no product left over, and that they won't take responsebel for this. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR STORAGE SAYS, I HAVEN'T GET MY PRODUCT THAT I HAVE PAID FOR!!!! Send the support a new Email but i suppose it will take weeks befor i get another answer from them. Wish i Would read all the warnings here befor i ordered from them. Maybe i have to remind them that It's illegal to take charge for something and then don't deliver the product? It is beyond the worst thing I ever experience from an Internet buyer and I will never ever by from them again! And I won't even recommend my worst enemy to by from beautybay.com It's so embarrassing it can get!! Is this how you take care of your coustomers beautybay?
Wimdu is great! It saved me and girlfriend alot of money to spend on the things we really were prepared to pay for, during our trip to USA. Ford Mustang, great restaurants and shopping.
I ordered flowers and a bottle of sparkling wine for my step daughters birthday in Spain. After being in contact with her a few days after her birthday, she hadn't received anything. So I checked my account at FloraQueen, that said that the order was delivered. So I contacted FloraQueen, and asked what has happened, they told me that the order was delivered. So I asked my step daughter to check with her neighbours if they perhaps had recieved it, but no one had. I contacted FloraQueen again, and the next reply I got was "We are going to contact our local florist in order to investigate further, and we will get back to you shortly.". They never got back to me though so I contacted them a third time, telling them that I now wanted my money back for this extremely bad service, and the reply I got then was "Thank you for your order with FloraQueen and sorry for the delay. Our local floris never delivered your order. We regret to inform you that the following recipient contact details provided are incorrect: • We need a Spanish number If you wish, we can deliver it with an external delivery service or proceed to a full refund." (the phone number was not incorrect..) Great, I wanted my money back so that was a good option. I replied saying that I wanted my money back and that would've been fine. I then recieve "We are sorry, we can not proceed to a refund. The delivery address was incomplete, the phone number was foreign. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused." WHAT? The delivery address is NOT incomplete, and the phone number IS correct, and also, they have MY phone number, and according to FloraQueens FAQ at their homepage, they need my phonenumber because "Customer service may need to speak to you to confirm the recipients address, to modify the order or to confirm payment details. We will only contact you by phone in relation to the order you have recently placed." And I can swear that my phonenumber is correct!! But noone from FloraQueen has contacted me. And a foreign phone number? I thought FloraQueen was providing flower deliverys all over the world, how can a phone number Not be foreign? Am I supposed to get a Spanish phone number to be able to order from Sweden?? So, I've paid €41 for NOTHING. Do not EVER use FloraQueen unless you want to hand them your money for nothing. Im so disappointed in all this and I will spread my message in as many ways that I can think of so that no one else will get robbed.
I bought two In-wall speakers from this seller, first through Ebay and was so pleased with the service from this seller and the sound from the speakers that I ordered another pair directly from this seller. Both times it was fast shipping ans fast reply when asking questions by mail.
Bought a Barbour jacket wich was priced about 25% lower than any local store (Sweden), it was shipped within 24h and they bundled a complementary scarf. Free and fast worldwide shipping, you can't beat it.
Very professional and knowledgeable people at Pediwear. I highly recommend them.
This is where I buy my golf gears when no custom fitting is needed.
I bought 2 Axial Jeeps. Delivery was fine and I received both cars as ordered. After just one or two run with one of the cars the ESC did not respond anymore. I made a complaint to the company but they were at that time not interested in helping me with the problem. As they told me the model is not advertised as waterproof then the UK distributor will not cover damage caused by water ingress/damp under their warranty. First after my additional respond they offered me to see at the ESC, but at that time I had already bought a new one from another company.
Order and shipping worked ok for me. I received my order in 7 days and my items were in good condition.
The product was great, but UPS made it a bad experience. They tried to deliver the merchendice at daytime when I was at work, and there was no way for them to say what time they could come. I ended up getting the package one week late on my day off because I had to be home from 8-17 waiting for them. My advice, dont buy from companies who use UPS.
I bought a pretty expensive guitar from Thomann. When I read the specifications the guitar had pretty unusual frets for the model (stainless jumbos), I contacted them specifically regarding this and they told me that the information was correct. It was not. When I got the guitar I opened the case and read the specs inside from the manufacturer - they were neither stainless nor jumbos. I am very pleased with the guitar anyway so I didn't want to return it, but I think it is really crucial that the information is correct when buying a guitar online.
Ordered a guitar (EBMM JP6) on a Sunday to Stockholm, Sweden - got it on Thursday, pretty fast! God price as well and got answer to emails both before and after purchase. Thanks.
Extremely nice and competent personel who resolved all my questions with confidence. I also tried accessing via the web but that was extremely slow and I nevet got through. On phone however staff responded quickly and efficiently.
Yes, I found a hotel room for a very low price, and it said "only one room left!". But surprise, surprise - this last room was left AFTER I had booked the last room. Smells fishy.
Was a bit confused when I saw two transactions, but it sorted itself out.
The only thing I could have wished that Oneplay could have had made more clearer is that you won't get your key until the dyay before it's launched. Then what's the use it Origin allows you to pre load your game?
I am very satisfied and will be coming back again.
Great quality earrings and fast delivery.. a bit expensive though but its worth it.
Im in love with my Marc Jacobs watch bought from The watch Hut! I payed 1000 swedish crowns less than in the store and received it home fast and well packade!!!! Perfect!!!!
I bought myself INOV8 road-x 255 I got them fast and to a far better price then I would in a shop in Sweden.
Hello from sweden! Safe to buy from and the best :FREE delivery to sweden. I really recommend to everybody
This was a great experience, I will definetly do this alot more in the future !
Good and Quick service, easy to shop and shipping abroad within EU is great!
I hardly recommend spelbutiken.se. It's very good prices and you'll get you're order very fast and if it's not to big you'll always get it in you're mailbox. Big thumbs up!
I by all my Tools and Machines for my business from Axminster and have done so for several years. Great prices, excellent customer support, always in stock and very fast deliveries
Did everything they were supposed to-do in a timely manner.
Was in need for a single sparepart for my project and scooter-center was the only shop that had what i was looking for in stock. The price was good and the shipping cost for door to door delivery by UPS was a real bargain. 6€ for shipping to Sweden, thats cheaper then sending local post inside Sweden. Package dispatched same day from Scooter-Center and arrived 2-days later. Top notch webshop i wish all internet based webshop was like this.
good range. easy to order. very fast delivery. only positive experience
Nice shop for bikes/parts. Excellent prices. Would be nice if there was a mid-price delivery cost which includes parcel tracking. Ordered two times from Cyclestore now, and both times the order has taken more than ten days to be delivered. Becomes frustrating when i can't track the order to see were it is when delivery is delayed. Also very nice customer service.
so fast and cheap freigt! good homepage and parts to any scooter
It has taken time to get my watch, and I'm still waiting. After getting several and confusing mails, I contacted TradeInn.com. I got apologies and the delivery charges returned. But 18 days without having my product is not acceptable...
I like to create flowers etc out of sugerpaste and have bought many great tools there for a super low price! would higly recomend this for everyone
I have ordered from Country Attire once, and my experience was great. The only negative aspect was that it took 2 weeks for my product to be delivered (I live in Sweden), and I had no tracking to follow the shipment. Also, my Hunter Boots for toddlers were packed in a bag, not in its original box... Other than that there were no problems with my order. I would definitely order from Country Attire again. I love that they have free shipping!
I have ordered from Forever21 multiple times and have never been disappointing. I live in Sweden and the items have always arrived in just a few days - right to my doorstep. Great service and amazing clothes!
I placed an order for two pairs of items (in stock items, may i add) on Feb 28. On March 7-10 I still hadn't received any information from Chicnova about my order. I emailed their customer service who replied after a couple of days saying that they would ask their warehouse to ship the items asap. Another 3 days went, no reply. I asked once more, and the customer service rep told me that the items would not be restocked. They asked me if I would like to change my order to something else. My order was a total of $35. I asked if they had stock on a $30 dress, the customer service rep told me that they could switch the order to this dress for an additional $6 (!!!!???) I told them to cancel everything and reimburse me. They never replied so I started a Pay Pal-dispute. They told me I would have my money back in 2-3 days. Today it is March 24th and I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED MY MONEY. Avoid at all costs!!!! Their customer service is in China - they do not reply. They do not refund. They do not give you any information. This is a SCAM company. I cannot believe that they are allowed to operate and fool people like this. Shame on you Chicnova!!
Quick replies and good information of my questions prior to deciding on which controller to pick and the purchase. Fast delivery to Sweden and great customer support! Thanks Vesternet! I will come back for more...
Great products and great value for money :) Have not received my order yet but so for good
Even though the fault was on me Moo reprinted my cards, no questions asked. Their service is more than worth their five stars and so are their products. I recommend them as often as I can.
I live in Sweden, order a bikini and a bra from you. Bras and bikinis in bigger cups are very expensive here and also hard to find in normal stores. The order is in my house within 5-7 days. The bikini and a bra fits perfectly, it costs about 40 pounds less, inkl delivery costs, than here in Sweden! It's too good to be true!!! I will tell all my friends to order from you and I will order another bikini from you already tonight! THANK YOU!!!
Bought Battlefield 4 with premium. The Battlefield 4 key worked but the premium key was already used according to origin. Sent a mail with screenshots of the problem and received a new code within 24 hours, good service.
I'm satisfied with the bag and the fast service :)
i have been a Real true customer to Spelbutiken for a long time and i hope they still gonna have good prices,fast shipping and good service in the future. like i said in my opinion the best of the best! Nino Rajic
The Sinusrinse kit...the best invention ever! Using it when I have a cold or pollen allergy...and it really relieves the symptoms significantlly! Shopping on their site is just as great as the product! :-)
I bought one pair of Oakley prescription sunglasses, and the quality of the glasses, the speed of the manufacturing and delivery...and of course the price really made me happy! Excellent service!
I have had my webshop hosted with One.com since 2006. Sometimes the e-mail or website have had short downtime but overall I've been happy. However, the recent 24++ hour downtime has made me change my mind. The handling of this issue has been outrageously bad. Why didn't One.com notify all affected customers at once? My company is loosing money for every minute that passes and I can't reach my files to move everything to another host. Most of all I am surprised to see that One.com doesn't seem to mirror their servers? Or why else do they need to examine every single file on the servers before going online again? What I have learned from this is that in the end you get what you pay for. It's time for me to pay a little more to get something much more stable.
They don't ship every day, which I think is just lazy. Other than that it's really good!
I sent a request to MemoryC and got all information I needed. They helped me in an excellent way. This was the second time I ordered something from this customer and I will continue to do it. From order to delivery in Sweden was 2 days. You can't get it faster by post. I also received an e-mail when it was shipped. If it was possible I should give this Company more than 5 stars.
It was really easy to order, i got it delivered very fast to a good price. I am gonna use this site more
When we were looking for a high quality (but not to expensive) tent for shorter summer expeditions, we found an excellent tent from Kampa on Camping World´s home page. When we put it up for the first time in our back yard, we were pleasantly surprised to see that it was perfect! The quality exceeded our expectations and we are looking forward to putting to good use next year.
I have not received what I ordered on 2014-05-12 and they promise a delivery 3-5 days och nu har det gått 23 dagar. So I can not give a rating on the goods I ordered. I knew that it would take this long I would not have ordered my golf bag. Best regards C//H
Satisfied with the products. My only concern was the delivery time for my main item in the order that took almost 2 months to get (even though it was said to be in stock). I understand perfectly that some popular items can be delayed but it would have been better to know this to begin with than to be told that it might take another 1-2 weeks a couple of times when it ended up being 8-9 weeks...But overall I'm happy with my order and the staff was always helpful, and of course the prices incredible compared to Swedish prices.
Hard to beat pricewise for any Web store and as far to my experiences they have the best shipping logistics in Europe at the moment. Can highly recommend them
Good service and quick response on questions via e-mail and phone support. The price for my item was excellent and was delivered to the door by DHL. It was a week delay in the delivery but that was communicated will via e-mail. If you want an item promptly you'll go to a store in this case I choose to save 40% (saved about €220) and had the item delivered - I can live with a week delay. If my coming experiences with this shop is as smooth as this one was then I'll give them 5 stars for sure.
The return was easy (but very expensive) and I was refunded as soon as the jacket had returned. I wish JulesB could offer the measures of the products on their website.
Who needs a new car and pay at least double?
OnePlay almost always has the best prices on the market and fast deliveries even when you are not a premium customer.
Have to admit I'm a big fans of Evans cycles but have always been a customer of Merlin's for years. The reason is the quality of service is exceptional. Never had a problem ordering and now I live abroad In Sweden i am super impressed .dispatch time is unbelievable and delivery comes in a matter of days, and that's for bulky items!
Was very fortunate to get the Kunzmann Base Doctor II at an excellent price during a promotional period. Was really needed to fix some serious damage to a set of skis.  Spoke with the team over the phone and found them very pleasant. Told them I needed the product ASAP as was taking it out the country. Was really happy to find the Kunzmann Base Doctor II had arrived the following morning 2hrs before my flight. Couldn't have been happier with the turnaround.
No complains. Took a few days from UK to Sweden, but then I had it in my mailbox at home.
Placed an order for over 600. Everything was sent here but one of the parts did not fit my car . Placed the order because they claimed it would fit my car . Is in contact with support for over 1 hour where the only thing they manage to come up with is that the part should theoretically fit my specific car models according to their " specialists " . And to proceed they want me to return the product where the return shipping would cost more than the actual product value , so even if I would get my money back I would lose more money, I earn more on throwing the misfit part in the junkyard . Briefly , it is no knowledgeable people behind the company , despite filling in their specific car model and they claim that it will fit your car , this is no guarantee that it will fit in the end. Customer Service is LOUSY when they are not willing to cooperate , if any problem occurs, you can expect to find it tough . The conversation was cut twice on some " mysterious " way, after the second time I am not able to contact them again. They buries their head in the sand and wish anything but to help. So bad customer treatment and non reliable products.
It was easy to use the website for order. My print arriwed very quick.
Merlin Cycles provided me with what I needed and sent it to Sweden with free p&p. Excellent selection and excellent prices.
With low pricetag and quick delivery I am very pleased to buy electric tools from you.
I ordered 2 chairs in June 2013. After many delays, Infurn could not even give an estimated date of arrival. In October 2013 I cancelled the order and was promised a refund within 30 days. Several times I have contacted Infurn, and lately they stopped replying to my emails. I would NOT recommend people to buy from this company. On the Feb 18th, 2014, I got an answer from Infurn here on Trustpilot that my issue (getting my refund) would be resolved within the coming few days. It's now been two weeks and still no money on the account or other feedback from Infurn.
When visiting New York you have to stop by B&H. I promise you that they will do anything to help you and that you will find what you are looking for. The price is right, no question about it.
Unbelievably poor service! If I could award ZERO stars, then that would be appropriate - no service in that organization! Booked and paid ITIL v3 OSA  (5 days classroom course) more than a month before the course due to start. I made the 'order handler' (contact person) very aware of the fact that I was traveling from abroad, to London to attend the course. Got an email after a week asking if I would like to participate in an class with a earlier start date - to which I declined the offer and asked if there was anything wrong with the course I had registered for? answer was -"nothing wrong, just attempting to be service minded". Booked and paid for hotel and travel, after confirming with the order handler at  TheKnowledgeAcademy that class was on schedule. Traveled to London one day before the course was due to start (e.g. on a Sunday) and traveled to pre agreed venue for the course, early Monday morning - just to be informed by the venue front-desk, that they didn't have any TheKnowledgeAcademy course scheduled to start that day (in fact the venue could not see any booking for the course I was due to attend). I called TheKnowledgeAcademy and asked for my contact person, just to be informed that my contact person had stopped working for TheKnowledgeAcademy (then my call was dropped, while in queue). I received a call from TheKnowledgeAcademy 10 min later - 20 min before the course was due to start, informing me that 'my' class was canceled. I have later attempted to get information from TheKnowledgeAcademy. regarding my case but has always been meet with sub-zero approach and it took more than 2 months for TheKnowledgeAcademy to refund the course fee! NO compensation for additional costs associated with their failure to info me of the cancelation! - I have never been service so poorly!
The order came in time and there were no trouble.. The prdoukt works great and it came to a great price.
Fantastic service, Quick help when I messed up my daughters present. Fast delivery to Sweden, less than a week from order, and half the price from a store.
Awesome liquids, was a bit of a problem with stuff apparently not being in stock, but got contacted by the customer service. Overall happy :)
If you want great games for awesome prices then Spelbutiken is the store for you!
The whole process of ordering from UK Juicers was splendid! I made my order online, followed by some (nice) personal service through e-mail, followed my be receiving the goods after less than a week (I live in Sweden)! I was quite surprised, and very, very content about the quick delivery!
I don't have much to say since everything worked as it should. Great price, easy to order and fast delivery.
I've purchased games from this site many times now and I've never had any trouble. The support answers all your questions quickly and the games are really cheap! I recommend this site to anyone who wants to save a few bucks on buying games, it's really worth it.
I am quite satisfied with all products I have bought from Sleepo. I continue checking first sleepo shop-site every time I need  something  specially bed-related items.
I first order a stroller from an other company but they could not deliver on time. In a panic i contacted Babycare and they immediately responded. They quickly gave me all the information I needed and they shipped out the stroller the same day. Three days later i could pick it up at my local supermarket in Sweden! If I need something else in the future I will definitely buy from Babycare again and I will recommend my friends to do the same.
I Always compare prices and Chainreactioncycles usually comes out as the Winner. My last order was for a set of hydraulic MTB disc brakes and some other stuff. Later the same day I received a promotion email from Chainreaction offering a 10% discount on all components. Typical, just a few hours after I placed the order.... After contacting Chainreactions customer service, they replied that they would refund 10% on the components that I purchased! -Great service. There seems to always be problems with the delivery of the goods from Chainreaction, probably because I live abroad, in Sweden. However, Chainreaction has always helped me in every way and it has ended well every time.
I'm perfectly happy with all aspects of this purchase. Would happily use again, definitely recommend to others.
It should be noted in the lamp description that the bulb socket is minion-type
This was my second time ordering from boohoo and I am still a very pleased customer. the shipping goes incredibly fast even though I live in Sweden and the clothes fitted perfectly this time as well. :) Will definately order from Boohoo again!
Very nice to choose from, as well as great prices and fast delivery.
I think country attire has a great service and the products are excellent. I ordered from Sweden and had no problems at all with the order. Love my new west. I will definitely order from them again, maybe soon because there were more than one item than catch my eye...
You had the best price!  I was looking for a single trip back to Rio and you where the cheapest  - Thanks!
Its not difficult to be better than Ryanair. I experienced both negative and positive things with Easyjet.  Once a cancelled flight at Gatwick airport was handled poorly be the understaffed personnel at the airport. But their online service is very nice and helpful. Email messages are answered promptly with a positive attitude. and when you are in the air as well. Problems can arise with all airlines and Easyjet I will use whenever I can in the future.
once I bought  some flower seeds who never arrived - my (very small) payment was lost. They trusted the seller. Some month ago I purchased a laptop. The laptop was lost on they way. First they claimed the address was wrong (which was not the case) they admitted this later but still no money was returned as it got lost after passing trough customs in Italy. I specially ask for expedited and paid over $100 more for it.  No help at all. Will never buy anything again via Ebay.
Its not the first time I am using traveljigsaw often has the best deal
I placed my order on Oct 21, 2011. It´s now Feb 7, 2012. Still no delivery. I´ve e-mailed nurmerous times. At first they replied, when I asked about the delivery date (said to be 4-6 weeks - turned out to be 10-12 weeks!!). When finally receiving an e-mail re delivery, the package was said to be at the Swedish post office. I didn´t receive any message re the package from the post office. When I called the post office after the Swedish long holiday in January, thinking the package had just arrived, I found out that it had been there more than 2 weeks already and was just send back to Germany!!! After that I have not had a single reply to my e-mails asking how they are going to solve this. I have paid the product, I have paid the freight cost and have not received what I paid for and have now realized that I will not be neither reimbursed nor receive my order. It may be that the Swedish post office is to blame also for not sending me a notice about the package but I CAN`T MAKE THAT CLAIM!!!! Infurn must act - and I AM THE CUSTOMER! I will never ever buy from Infurn again and even more, do whatever I can so that my friends don´t either. They are completely unprofessional and have not understood that customers are important for a company selling products...  Customer support is non-existent. As a customer I have been very badly treated. So, my recommendation - do not buy anything from Infurn.com!
Dude you should order from this site it's very good with fast shipping and good respond time on the order
This is now the third time I have purchased goods from Country Attire. All three times have been absolutely satisfactory. Chat for support on size guiding works well. Goods mailed to Sweden arrived in a timely manner 4-5 working days using Royal Mail. I can easily recommend this company for internet purchase.
Ordered a pair of tires from them, fast service and great communication.
Quick delivery and and many good products for a great price.
I ordered a Lacie Rikiki 500GB on 10 November. I did not receive my order until 22 nov. Very slow delivery when their page states 3-4 days. After plugging in the HD I find out that it is broken. I can not back up my files. This is not Pixmania's fault, but when you go to return order  section on their site they urge you to contact the Manufacturer. Why should I have to contact Lacie? I have a contract with Pixmania who has sent me a broken product. I just want to return the HD as soon as possible. I expect Pixmania to pay for the return cost. Anyhow I have written to their support. I might follow this review up once i have their reply (which should be within 24 hours according their automated mail response)... update 29 november. Pixmania did respond and in a positive manner. they have made a small refund due to the long delivery and offered to take back the product. However i have discovered that it was in fact not the drive that was faulty but the longer USB 2.0 cable that I used. It works fine with the short USB cable it comes with and when changing to another USB 2.0 cable it runs just fine. I have changed status from ** to **** because of professional customer service and good prices. I will shop there again just not when I'm pressed for time. Thank you to Nina for responding.
This guys are simply great to deal with.. And a very very nice jersey. Tried it this morning and it fit and felt like it should. Another good buy.
I was unfortunate to encounter a wrong size chart when ordering, and 2 pieces of swim wear came in too small size. I contacted Customer Service who were very service minded and quick in communication. They also managed to get the website corrected within the very same afternoon. This is a professional company who cares about their customers. Quick delivery outside U.K.
I have ordered several times from Chemist Direct and I have had no problem except the last time. My last order was not arrived on time and I decided to contact the costumer service. They typically respond within 24 hours which is OK. They wanted me to wait 20 days (excluding weekends) before claiming that the order was lost. After this period, I contacted them again and I was told that a new order had been sent. After one week, I got the new order as expected. It proves me that they are doing their job in a very professional way and I am going to order new stuff again as they offer good prices as well.
Very fast delivery. I would prefere a longer expire date !
I made an reservation with hotelsclick since they were cheapest on the hotel I chose. After looking at to many different dates I ended up booking the wrong period and emailed Hotelsclick. A very polite response the next day confirmed that they had changed my booking according to my request without any extra fee. Thanks!
I was pretty disappointed at the delivery time and the service from the company. It was cheaper than sweden but i don't think i will order from them again because of the things i wrote. the time of waiting was more than a week longer than they said it should take.
My order was shipped to Sweden in fast, reliable way even if with free shipping. I wanted to return my first order because of the size and the customer service answered fast and answer my questions. A big plus for free shipping to Sweden.
I'm a swedish woman living in Italy. I have been using protein supplements for about 20 years now and I must say that these have the highest quality! The different tastes aren't bad either. The price is very low. Now my son is using it to, he plays hockey on a high level. The only problem that  has occurred is to blame on the shipper. DPD sucks!
Easy to order, fast e-mail confirmation and a very fast delivery. The only disadvantage was that I didn’t receive the tracking e-mail. Therefore I had no idea when UPS were coming… And I’m not a fan of UPS… But they delivered a second time without fuss.
Ive been using their hair product for a while now. It's helped with my receding hairline and my hair feels thicker. Customer service is top notch. Can't ask for a better seller. A+++++
I bought a Braemar kilt jacket. It arrived but was the wring size, the sleeves were too short. This was due to an incorrect measure guide. When I tried to have it exchanged for a kilt jacket the right size they wouldn't do it. They wouldn't give an inch to help me and now I have a kilt jacket worth over £20 hanging in my wardrobe for no use at all. I am still so disappointed and the whole thing just makes me sad and feeling befooled. This was the second time a thing like this had happened dealing with Heritage of Scotland. The first time was when I ordered a casual polyviscose kilt. It was supposed to be of 24" drop but was shorter. Sadly, I wasn't helped this time either.
