After various complaints (torn package,faulty clothes,spot on clothes) i thought to give it another chance, Ordered 2 shirts and only one was delivered. Saw on my bank statement that the money was credited but never received mail or other communication why this was. There are enough other brands who sell better quality and treat their customers with more respect then Desigual ! Return policy also lousy, your money is returned and you have to place new order (and pay delivery cost) and when the garment is sold out tough luck ! They don't make the effort to help you get it.
I have used the service two times now. It actually works as promised on the website. The only thing I am nervous about is the exchange rate, because untill the actual transaction is set you are not sure of it. So far its ok, but what if the exchange rate suddenly drops.
Good company, very simple to make reservation on the internet. Very friendly staff.We arrived too early on the airport but without extra payment we could pick up the car imediately. No extra payment second driver!!
The ordering process, product and process time for Healthysupplies were excellent.  I have absolutely no complaints. I live in the Netherlands so international shipping is required.  They used GLS couriers which is not a well known or often used courier here. When your package is not delivered they have an arrangement with random shops all over the city to hold it for pickup.  We ended up having to travel to a Launderette which was not on the public transport route. I would recommend buying from Healthysupplies, but if your package is being delivered by GLS I would make sure you are at home to avoid having to go for the pickup.
Picked up the car, which had over 100.000 km on the clock, lot of damages, and dirty inside. Service from the pickup location was ok, all damages have been reported. Allthough in the contract it was stated that the car would be delivered with a full tank, it was empty. Furthermore, the fee for returning on a different location was not, as published, 70 EUR, but 90 EUR. Returning the car in Thessaloniki was an unpleasant experience, since Hertz only had ONE staff member available for collection of the cars, and bringing people to the airport. Waiting time was unacceptable long. The guy appologized, said that the Hertz organization made budget cuts in their staffing policy, and reduced it to, according to me as a customer, onacceptable low level. We don't blame the staff member, he was ashamed a appologizing many times. But, for the amount of money we paid, this was definately not good value for money. Dirty, old car, agreements (full tank, 70 EUR location fee) NOT met, understaffed dropoff point in Thessaloniki.
The store keeps you up to date in terms of shipment very quickly. Usually, shopping via Ebay, items are sent and delivered here (in the Netherlands) the next day after I've recieved notification. Covers that I've bought from them have all been of excellent fit and quality, and the one time there was an issue they responded very promptly and correctly. All in all: Awesome store!
My order came in exactly five days after ordering.  (In the Netherlands) the clothes were of good quality in relation to it's price. I loved their shoes, very cheap and high quality. Didn't like the jewelry that much, got broken the first night I was ore it.
The dress was a little too big but i fix that by myself. Delivery was fast and thank you for the magazine, i really like that!
Why do you want to spend so much money for a hotel room. With 9 flats you find nice appartments for a fair price.
I have Tom-tom's car navigator and I can't say I'm really thrilled. It gets 'confused' every so often and tells me to perform U-turn while I'm on a highway... Not to even mention when I go into a tunnel.
Fast service and good product, received three bonus condoms. One condom was damaged, so they sent me some more immediately
our orde came in the next day - very fast and reliable, we are very happy with the service of this company
Good service, fast, easy to use. Around 10 days later I still hadn't received my purchased item. I called - it was out of stock and would come later. I received it nearly three weeks after ordering it. Ideally, the item should have been displayed as "out of stock" already when I ordered it. Alternatively, Fietspunt.nl should've contacted me after a couple of days and let me know that it would take longer.
Watches1st has is all. They have lots of watches in stock to choose from. They sent my package the same day and they were helpful after the delivery. Best internetshop I have seen so far.
I was pleased to receive a coupon of an upcoming game I wanted to buy, so of course I immediately put it to good use. Sadly I had to do quite some researching to find out that you will receive the key to activate the game on steam quite a while later (preventing you from perhaps pre-loading it). I don't blame greenman for not giving me the key (because they probably don't have it!), but I would've liked to be officially informed that I would get the key on the release day, or if I'm in luck a couple of days before.
I'm fully impressed by the price and the updates I got about the order and the progress of the delivery. It makes all very reliable. DHL is perfect in tracking the parcel. An excellent choice of eGlobal. A site I will visit for sure in the future for nice bargains.
a great apartment, close to Metro(Batistini) - good value for money
So the driver was a bit rude in communication, but that could also just be his way. He drove too fast when he could and was frustrated with the London traffic. You know? It's just traffic, it's been like this forever and arent you used to it? Stop huffing and puffing in agony. It was a 1.5 hr ride, and almost 2 hr back, he knew at the start of the drive it would be a long was... When i got to my destination, it was slow moving traffic (not on a standstill) He asked me to get out and walk, than he could leave the area and pick up another job. Really? I'm very pregnant and he knew... He did like the sandwich and apple that i got him...after he was complaining that i should have gotten lunch before getting back in to the return ride. Listen, we were  in the middle of nowhere, and if it was so bad to make a 5 minute stop for a get take-away-supermarket-sandwich? Dont take the offer than... I WILL call the company again, maybe he has a better day, maybe i'll have a different driver.
perfect p p p p p p p p p p
Easy to reach with the chat service, they always have a great Molo collection and they send the package the same day when I order during business hours!
De tas zag eruit zoals op de website en ik had de tas binnen 4 dagen in huis.
It's even cheaper then the most dutch shops here. I would prefer this to anyone with a low budget
On the CMS website, I'm able to find the parts I need quite easy, thanks to the parts diagrams on the website. My bike is kind of 'best of 2 years', which happens to occur with older Japanese bikes, and in that case it just wouldn't be doable to find the right parts. CMS site works great and great service.
Ever since I used Hostelbookers.com for the first time a couple of years ago, it's the first website I check for cheap accommodation whenever I travel. It's clear, simple, visually attractive, and it's a great way of browsing through accommodation all over the world. It's even got filters to narrow down the scope of what you are looking for! I recommend Hostelbookers to anyone who is looking for a place to stay :)
All that UKPLC says it will do, it does so and in a clear way.
I bought a lot of games on this site, they are the cheapest around! When you pay you will get the key within the minute. What more do you want. No need to get out of youre house to spend time in the sun waiting in line for a expensive disk. You can stay in youre house forever!!
I have always been pleased with Figleaves. Great service, by phone, by e-mail or by post. Products have always been great. A very trusteable company with great products and great service. Too bad we don't hav ethem in The Netherlands. But no panic for me ... I just order them in the UK and have very reasonable shipping costs too. Happy me!
I was fortunate to find the Alto IPa so cheap at Nevada Music, however, living in The Netherlands I expected the shipping to be expensive, but it wasn't at all! This makes Nevada Music a very good international retailer!
Immediate problem solving! I accidentally ordered two instead of 1 sweater. Upon writing per email one sweater cancelled and money returned, keeping me informed by mail! Recommendable!!
Cab in time, follow up from CC really customer friendly, thnx
Met name de quinoa vind ik te duur, maar de rest is wel redelijk.
Nice webshop with free European Shipping. The products have gold prices and it is good to watch the little video's bevoer purchasing products.
This was a great booking through Hostelbookers again!!! I have booked quit a few hostels and i am always satisfied. It is a simple and easy way to book a hotel!!! Thanks Titus van Mierlo
I cancelled my flight with Bravofly within 24 hours of booking. I was told to get a refund, not for the whole amount because of administration and creditcard costs, which seemed reasonable. I was fine with that. The guy I spoke to, however, was extremely rude to me and spoke in a language that could barely pass for English. He did tell me I would get the refund within 3 days. And I was happy to receive a confirmation e-mail of the cancellation and a statement that the refund was already predisposed. So far, so good. HOWEVER, it's been almost 3 weeks now and I have called Bravofly customer service a total of 5 times, because I still haven't received the refund. Every time I call it costs me €6,10! Of course, that would not be a problem if I would only have to call once and get a satisfying answer. This is NOT the case, however. Each time I call I get a different answer on how long it will take to receive the refund. Only once apologies were made for the delay in refunding me the amount I am entitled to. And this week the girl I talked to told me it should never take more than 7 days for refunds. It's now been almost 3 weeks! Once again I get a: "Yes, madam, within 2 days, you will be refunded the amount." Fine, I wait another 2 days. Still nothing!! Then today, I call again and I hear: "No, madam, you'll just have to wait. We're waiting for the refund from the airline." He cannot even give me an indication. This is completely ridiculous! I was actually planning to book another flight with Bravofly, but obviously, I'm completely fed up with this company and will advise anyone: NEVER BOOK WITH BRAVOFLY!
On buying articles and not being satisfied, one has to pay 20% of the sum to return the same articles. No money back guarantee. Which in my view is quite absurd.
I wanted to buy a pair of Geox ladies shoes on website of Vimodos at very competitive price. However, the supplier of Vimodos could not deliver on time due to technical problems. I was informed by Vimodos about the reason for not receiving the shoes in time in an e-mail, and about the fact that my money has already been transferred back to my account as Vimodos could not let me know when the supplier would be able to solve the technical problem. For sure, I will order from Vimodos in the future considering their service level. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I did not get the shoes; but I was still happy how my case was handled.
I live in Belgium but usually receive my goods just as quickly fron the UK when I order with Pharmacy2U.
Tires bought via the web. Good price. Appointment was made for delivery and putting tires onto the rims. Appointment confirmed via email. When I arrived no tires available and nobody even knew about my existence. Promisses to check everything and inform me after the weekend. Nothing heared of... Sed an email myself, no response again. Send an email to headquarters and finaly shop responded to inform me after max. two days. since then nothing received... I went by the shop again and it was promised that tires were available. Poor communication, poor customer treatment.
I received my order promptly, well packaged and at a competitive price, And would highly recommend Terence Paul.
I have ordered and received a Helly Hansen sailing jacket from Pro4sport. The item got here in time and in perfect condition. However, the communication was mediocre. No confirmation by mail or anything. After calling them twice and sending 2 emails I finally got the confirmation. It took the item about 2 weeks to arrive at my doorstep in the Netherlands. I am glad to have gotten the item as somewhere else was not possible. However the service is not perfect and when there would have been something wrong I wonder if everything would be handeled correctly. On the other hand I have also ordered something from them earlier through ebay where the reviews and service are near perfect. So maybe the company should aim some of there effort towards improving the service for customers buying from there site directly. Would buy again but with caution and by credit card/paypal so a draw back could easily be done. Just because of the communication and lack of confirmation and update.
I ordered purple magnet balls with an extra order of the 9 reserve balls. The reserve balls were sent in the wrong color. I sent an email and the problem was immediately resolved! Faster than I imagined!
ben heel erg blij met deze site en dat ze nog maar lang mogen doorgaan. echt top
The pills my GP recommended for a fraction of the price.
The website is easy to navigate. It's easy to find and order what I wanted and the cheapest I could find. Free shipping to the Netherlands and delivered within 3 days of despatch.
A time ago I ordered a football. Everything went well and I had no complaints at all; quick delivery, the right product, decent quality. Actually everything what I expected from Nike! But then, after a few months the football got broken. So I went to the customer service online and asked if they could repair my football, since I still had warranty. After waiting for days (/ weeks), I got no response. So I tried to contact them again, but this time with a different argument for repairing my football. Just in the hope they would respond to my mail! Surprisingly they responsed to my second mail, and they asked me why I mailed them few weeks ago with a different argument! So, they received my first mail, but didn't even respond to that one. But when they received another mail, with another argument, they come up with an argument to let me look like a liar! Still my football is not repaired and it seems they don't even bother about their customers once ordered a product. PS: the mail they sent me didn't even contain any relevant information (about repairing the football).
Got my BF4 key within a minute in my mailbox. Price is among he lowest on the web ...
I ordered 96 tins of cat food and 1 sack of dry food. By placing a large order I compensate the cost of delivery which is 7.50 pounds to the Netherlands. VetUK decided, without contacting me, that they would cancel the 96 tins because of stock outage and would just send me the sack charging 7.50 pounds delivery cost to my account. That is not the service you would expect!!!
great organization, good fun, nice revenue, Just take the time, add some photos of your place and wait for guests to visit you. In the past you had to go out to get new friends and that costed money. Now you can stay home, make it cosy and get new friends from all over the world + they leave some money for the services! Just do it and enjoy.
Far better than Western Union by far, better service also
We loved riding with Bigbustours! We took the 48 hrs ticket en enjoyed two days of London. The people of Bigbustours are very friendly and helpfull. The next time I would do it again. The only downside was the rivertour. We waited for two hours to get on a boat but that wasn't going to happen. So we skipped the imens line and did not do the rivertour. This happened on 13/7/2013.
wonderful flowers....super service at good prices too. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for flowers and delivery at good prices and exceptional quality....
I ordered a extention ladder with delivery direct from the factory, due 22 July. It has still not been delivered. I contacted J2B via their website and via email but they do not answer. I guess this will become a legal matter to get my money back. Scam.
Always an adventure, renting a car abroad. Billund Airport is a small airport where the rental agency is conveniently located in the hall. Finding the car was somewhat harder, the location was a general description. We spend some time scanning all the license plates. The car itself was a pleasant surprise, the C category estate turned out to be an almost brand new Mondeo estate with built in navigation on a big touchscreen. This, together with the state of the art parking assistance was a big help driving in and around Aarhus and its rather crampy parking garages.
boohoo.com was introduced to me by a friend of mine after i commented that her purse was to die for. it looked really high end to me, when she told me the price she paid i was amazed. the next day i took a look for myself and ended up buying a lot of clothing and have never stopped since. boohoo has a lot of trendy and basic clothes for a good price. and the best thing is that the shipping is free (at least to the Netherlands) and very fast. i receive my order within a week. i really enjoy the frequent coupon codes as well. i'm a fan!
De levering was perfect en het product van goede kwaliteit.
This was my first order @natureshop and first orders with companies i dont know yet always makes me a bit sceptical. What if? I read the reviews and they were all great. So I ordered and i'm very content: Within 3 days I got my order. Fantastic. Wo'nt hesitate one sec to place another order!
One time I ordered a Wii-Remote that did not work. I asked customer service if they could do something for me. They first offered me to check if I could get it fixed and they would compensate me for the costs. When I told them it was not an option, they just send me a new one for free!. Shipping takes a while, but this is because of the distance products have to travel, customs etc. Great store, I have recommended MANY of my friends to make an account and buy from Focalprice.com!
A two day visit to Paris with show arrangement was easily booked. The information on the website gave enough insight, and all our expectations were met. We enjoyed this trip very much and will use the site again when we plan our next short trip. Thanks for your splendid help.
we rented our car in Porto. Waiting on the airport shouldn't be necessery if information about the location of our Car Rent firm was on the form.  Also the difference according the phone numbers should be noticed.  I live in Holland and here we have 10 signs- numbers starting with a 0 . In Portugal its different, but it took an full hour before I came to that conclusion. Once I made a phone contact with the Car Rental Office,everything went perfect. So, very  good service after all, but a small remark.
When we arrived at Stansted the place where the bus would arrive was easily found. We waited there but the bus didn't come... the next one, the one we had a reservation for late or... wasn't coming either. We were waitnig inside. There was a man who asked about the easy bus to a member working there. He said he hadn't seen a easy bus in a while well that was true because the man had a reservation for a bus more than an hour EARLIER!! in more than an hour there wasn't one bus of easy bus.... luckily after about 20minutes wait for us there arrived an orange bus from easy bus. The bad news was that there were so many people waiting that not even half of the people waiting could be fit into the bus. We were one of the people who had to wait. The bus driver called his co-worker and said he would be there within 10minutes. Luckily that was sooner so after a few minutes there was an other bus. Still there were a lot of people waiting but luckily now we were one of the few who were able to get in. Still there were about 5 or 6 people waiting who didn't fit in. I hope they didn't have to wait that long for an other bus.... We were in London for a very very very short trip, just to see 1 show and go back to Holland again. The bus who would get us back to Stansted would depart at 2.30 that same night. We were reallly afraid that that bus would't show up either and that we would miss our return flight. Luckily the bus was there spot on on time and we were back at Stansted a few hours before our return flight... Although the bus did came... we don't know if we will trust easy bus next time... maybe just to be sure we will book an other bus or train...
Hi there,we were looking for a nice present for our friends in Scotland.Something nice, for a reasonable price, colourfull and something what wouldn't need days to reach them. The arrival of a new baby, is something you would give your congratulations right away. Sending a present by post takes a few days .Besides a lovely bounch of flowers, we also could add a small beargift with it ,to make the party complete.The lovely response the very next day when they received the gift,made the distance between us shorter.
It's easy to making and after the album looks very professional . Everybody is very delighted!
the books where good, one small fault that was corrected in a quick and good way
At Pharmacy2U I can get items that are not available in the Netherlands
good cheap products, delivery ok. Would prefer national postoffice so you can pick it up at a branch
My first contact with Citybase was Sunday March 10th. Because I send a mail during the closed hours I got an answer mail within the hour. An excellent service! The next day I received a mail that there wasn't a possibility for 2 days of my booking. Directly I did send another mail and I called the telephone number. I was helped direcly and friendly again. One hour later the new booking was confirmed. All and all a perfect solution for me and my family. But the main thing was the excellent overall service. A very warm shower to the employes of Citybase. Super! Ton, Angela and family from Holland
My order has to be shipped to the Netherlands and almost always it is delivered within a week. I am a very satisfied customer. Keep up the good work.
For months already I had my eye on the Oilily Backpack-Trolley.. But this time I really needed it for upcoming trips & lucky me, it was on sale now ! So I ordered it right away and I was really happy when it was delivered swiftly :-)
Dear reader, I came across HousTrip by chance and am very happy I did. The whole process of finding a suitable place to stay (website) thru booking, personal contact with an employee from HouseTrip (as well as the fact that I had a choice to speak to somebody in my own language) and being kept up-to-date on the progress through Emails ... perfect! HousTrip really deserves their 5 star rating as far as I'm concerned. ***** Kind regards from a very happy customer
Maybe not the cheapest but always the right parts I need. There is a good and quick answer to my questions. Great shopping!
I placed my order at your company. A total of 4 products from Urban Decay.....within 2 days it arrived in Amsterdam. I was so happy. Because it was my birthday and I could wear the make-up for the party. Everybody was asking me what a nice colours.....and I was proudly explaining them where I bouth the make-up and how quickly I received it.... More orders will follow. See you soon, Sylvia
ordering from outside the UK is no problem, I got my parts a few days later, top service, good packaged.
Maybe a website in English?? And i find the cost for delivery extreem high, over € 40 for dispatch to the Netherlands cost me more then the item itself...
I ordered a black discopants and it fits me perfect. The fabric is nice. I will buy more of these..
Top quick delivery and good product. I have serious bad experiences with Lamps-4-less, also buying a DLP-lamp. Compared to them, this company makes me a happy internetbuyer again. The lamp was send within a few days, no backorder or wrong types send, like at L4less. Ill be back!
I have had absolutely no complains in any of my orders up to now
Last week I ordered my first records, but as there aren't any good record shops in Belgium, I ordered them at Chemical Records. I ordered them on Monday, got the mail that they were shipped on Friday (friday delivery) and received them already on Tuesday! I'm very happy with the fast delivery and the services from Chemical Records, and I will certainly buy my other vinyls here too!
I booked my Eurail trip at Eurail.com and the website really helped me to plan my trip. There's great info about countries and trains. And the ordering process was very clear.
I found the website by accident as I was looking for Christmas cakes. I saw al these beautiful sweets, chocolates, cakes, soups etc, that I knew from my younger days. Going through the shop I got so greedy, that I could have ordered everything. I ordered quite a few things and overall am very happy with what bought.  More will be coming soon. It is not cheap, but if you see the way everything has been wrapped and the speed with which everything is delivered, you understand.  I am more than happy and, as said, more will be ordered soon.
Ships to the Netherlands in just a few days. Did not have had any problems or had to contact support.
On november 26 I placed an order for 210eu from Lookfantastic and Lookmantastic combined, all the items I ordered had "Usually dispatches within 24h" next to them. As one can expect in this day and age, I assumed the order would be shipped out the same day or at latest the next day. Instead I receive an e-mail the next day with the subject "Order cancelled", it turned out a free gift that I was supposed to receive with my order was out of stock and the e-mail only applied to this particular item, to compensate I received (the day after: nov 28) a coupon for 15% off on my next order valid until the end of november. WOW, thanks! Surely, I'll place an order again within 2 days even though my current order hasn't been shipped out yet. I didn't care too much since after all it was a free gift, but still the coupon was ridiculous to say the least. Fast forward a couple of days and still no update on my order. I decide to call them and ask what's up, the girl on the phone tells me my order is in the "dispatching process" so I expect it to ship out the same day. But, still no order update at the end of the day. I wait another day and decide to send an e-mail, part of the reason I ordered from Lookfantastic were the low prices compared to salon pricing, but since I've been waiting so long for my order I now had to go buy the more expensive product at a local salon, I included this in the e-mail. The next day I get a reply stating that the issue has been forwarded to the appropriate department, wow, so helpful! I decide to call again, the girl on the phone now tells me there seemed to be an issue with the IT system and that's why my order was stuck in "processing" and never went to "dispatching". Kind of weird though that the first time I called the girl told me the order was already in the dispatching procedure... Anyway, I decide to give up and just assume that my order will ship out at some point in the future. Then on december 7, almost 2 weeks after placing my order, I finally get an e-mail that my order has been shipped out. I have yet to receive it and their mail courier seems about as shady as they do: "trackmail.co.uk" without any reference to any company at all. All in all, I will 100% not buy from this place again, I have never in my life had such a bad experience with an online retailer, even ALL of my purchases on eBay were handled better. It's a shame since they carry such a good selection of products at fair pricing, but all the hassle that comes with it is just not worth it, I'd rather spent a couple bucks more at another place.
This webshop has a keen assortment with a functional website. Even for the rest of Europe it is easy to order the right product and get a fast delivery.
I am happy with hostelbookers.com. It is a site that offers sufficient good locations to stay that have low prices and good quality. The fact that you only pay 10% and can cancel short before departure, makes it very flexible. Some years ago when I was studying, I was only staying in hostels; now I am also looking for guesthouses and hotels. Hostelbookers offers both! I would definitiely recommend this site
Since the old site doesn't deliver to Germany anymore, the nice people of AOP transferred the information they could to the new one. My order, as before, arrived in Germany in less than a week, with the things inside the package in perfect condition. The actual plugs I ordered are comfortable and look good, which is pretty much the main thing I wanted.
This was better than shopping in the city. The wallet was delivered in less than 24h and I find that amazing. Will repeat shopping here, that's for sure!
what a stroke of luck! Finding the Roger Federer Olympic 2012 shirt that was sold out in CH en could not be ordered in NL, and then finding out it could be shipped to our Dutch adress so fast against very reasonable costs. Getting an E-mail to check all the details to make sure the right adress was used was also greatly appreciated. Within 1 week of placing the order the shirt was delivered to us. We will gladly shop with Tennisnuts again!!
heel duidelijk aangegeven om het merk en type cartridges op te zoeken
top collectie - what you see is what you get!
Notification of order received, order shipped and delivery all perfectly done. Fourth time I've bought from this site and each time without any problem at all - Well Done
er was een storing in het betalingsverkeer en even met ze gebeld en zeer correct en snel afgehandeld. heel veel lof
heel veel mode onder een dak en een snel en nete levering
Easy toe locate the item you need on the website, easy to place an order and a quick delivery.
i pre-ordered the game killzone mercenary (order 458561483) & since day one of the release date it was on stock but they didnt send me the game.  Customers who order it after the pre-order & paid more for it got prioritise. I just recieved the game today! How is it possible that i recieve it17 days after release date & i didnt recieved any pre-order bonus either! I recieved a regular edition with no download voucher ! Thats not the only thing couse they canceld another game & they send this answer: "this item is out of stock and it is not currently made available to us through our supplier panel". Within  one or two days it was in stock again but now for a far more higher price!!!
My order was handled fine. I got one e-mail from DiversWareHouse. A 'status update' e-mail (status changed to 'Despatched'). Six days later I received my watch. I live in the Netherlands so it was an overseas order. That's not bad. I think six days is definately not too long. The watch was packed properly, enough shock absorbing packing material was used to protect it during shipping. All in all a good shopping experience, no complaints so far. This purchase proves to me they handle overseas orders professionally and very well. So I would not hesitate to order from this company again.
Ifyou want to go to New York, I advise you to buy the New York Pass on internet. You will save money, have a lot of information, also about all kinds of tourist information beyond the highlights. And it is a pleasure to avoid the queues
very good shoes en de size is normal In 5 days i recieve the packet from England
I live in the Netherlands and ordered golfshoes. Two days after the order, I received an e-mail. Because the delivery should take a few days, they offered me the possibility of cancelling the order. What a great service! Of course I didn't do that, because I wanted the shoes. After 7 days I received the shoes. I think that is rather quick, for an international transport. A day after the order, I send an email with a question and they responded very quickly.
I just can say , i recommand this webshop. Service , price and delivery are just like they should be.
Ik bought some stuff at bang good.com and i like it very much they are very reliable and very cheap
Always difficult to have expectations with a foreign company. I ordered a pair of shoes (pricedifference with the netherlands €65,00 !!). Payment without troubles, no hidden fees and delivery also within the expected time frame. Just the Track and trace could have been better. There is no detail visible between 'order is send to the carrier' and delivered to the customer. With an international delivery several updates could have been done. But again, no problem. I will look at this site again when I need something they sell.
I got a beautiful dress and Im very happy with it! Also the delivery was very quick
All the things I could have wanted - not only for Christmas - but in the furture too! Very professionally packaged and received well within the expected time. Well done!
Ik ha d om half vijf het product besteld, en de volgende dag om twee uur had ik het al in huis.
I recommend this site if you need to buy cheap clothes. Very easy to navigate and easy to comprehend all Boohoo communication. The one thing I didn't like is that the parcel is delivered by Skynet and not by the Dutch national carrier PostNL. You cannot pick up the parcel at a post office or servicepoint in supermarket....
It was easy to book a car. At the airport all the necessary formalities were done within a few moments. Hope we get an amount back to compensate the fuel we had left in the tank. :)
Great site. Realy easy to find what you are looking for. The info of the products are good.fast payment en very fast delevery to the netherlands. I'm gonna shop here a lot more. Maybe a a track and trase code would be nice so you can follow your delivery
Order for the third time performed on a Canon SLR. Once a Canon body and twice a lens was the supply adequate and fast and I have some saved hundreds of euros. A site that is consulted by me always. The range should be something more extensive.
The day after the assignment was accepted and the payment had taken place, we got message that there were no contacts with Kissamos on Crete and that the order was canceled. There are at least three garden centres annex flowers I've seen traders who there itself. Thus no agreement. I instantly message given where the money can be refunded two weeks on no further reversal seen now. Not even a single comment! So I think: Beware! Unreliable!
Ordered several items, very fast delivery. had to return 1 item (size) and the refund was done very quickly as well.
Ive bought a product which has the mark with ''24 hours sending'' but within 48 hours i still didnt recieve it?
It took like 10 minutes to get my games from this website, i certainly will buy more in the future 5/5
Still waiting for the products to arrive, tough they should have been at home by now according to the emails, but i live outside uk so i still wait couple of days before i find it reason to complain, i will make another survey once i got the items to give proper rating
Great choice if you are looking for quality items. Simply the best with fast delivery even international...!
Booked a flight through this company and have now found that i am unable to get visa for my destination.  Called to try and arrange something else only to be told that the airline had applied the condition of not being able to change the booking at all.  Called the airline who say they have no restrictions on this booking, and that all restrictions are applied by BudgetAir.  Called BudgetAir back and they re-iterated that they have applied no restrictions to the ticket.  Now I'm in a circle where no-one is willing to try and help to find a solution.  Obviously i should have read the conditions more closely before booking, but I'm also just looking to find a solution to this problem (i.e. another flight from the destination to elsewhere), but that help is certainly not forthcoming from BudgetAir.  Futhermore, the fees to canel the flight are priced so that even the taxes can't be claimed back.  A company who hides behind excuses and conditions care certainly not a company who are looking to have a satisfied customer (if they had tried to work something out with me then a glowing review may have followed). I'm sure if you read the conditions closely (and have a degree in legal jargon), and no unforeseen circumstances arise, that you can have a good experience with BudgetAir, but if the unforeseen does occur then expect to be on your own.
Happy with the service, products and prices.  Delivery times are also good, and P&P is free if you order enough.  I have had one product which wasn't perfect (a lump of something white in it) and i find the bags they now use for the proteins not a great solution (they tend to split/not close properly).  This is why i have scored them as 4 and not a 5.
Good selection of products and good prices.  Everything went well except delivery which took ages from the date i ordered (about 2 weeks).  This wasn't a real problem, but it is worth being aware of for future orders.
Products are reasonably ok, and delivery is quick.  Personally i hate the Ryanair tactic of selling things - the prices you see is about half of what you need to pay to get the product.    If they were to change this then i would score them higher.
Ordered, and paid for, a product 35 days ago.  Completely no contact from the company about the order at all, then eventually got a response today to tell me that the product was no longer in stock.  That it took them 35 days to work out that it wasn't in stock says it all.
Ordered a couple of things, both of which were shown as 'in stock' on their website.  It turns out one of these was no longer in stock, which isn't very professional, and it took 5 days to communicate this to me (also unacceptable in this day and age).  They did offer an alternative to the product i'd ordered which was suitable for my purposes, but by the time this was all sorted out, it was 9 days before my product arrived.  In an age when most companies can get things there the next day, this is poor.  I did get (almost) what i wanted in the end though. One other big downside of this company is that they use the utterly useless post.nl for delivery.  A big improvement to the service would be the use of a better courier service.
Where to start?  Regularly i receive a card saying they tried to deliver something, but have been home all day and no-one has rung the doorbell (yes, i have tested to see if the doorbell is working on these occasions). They refuse deliver the package to my door (i live on the 3rd floor), not a problem generally, but it resulted in several packages being delivered to the local postkantoor (or sent back to the company) while i had a broken leg (where i couldn't collect them from because i had a broken leg).  They are the ONLY company that i have experienced who do not bring the packages to the door.  I've even been threatened by the delivery driver for taking too long to put my shoes on to go collect a package from him (he claims he wasn't threatening me, but it remains unclear why he would then tell me that he was going to come and visit me in the night with his Iranian friends).  The time it took me to put these shoes on was about 2 minutes.  The only way to change a delivery time is to register my details on their website - why they should need my personal details to do this is a mystery to me. I wouldn't use this company for anything, and if any online retailers do use them, then i make sure not to use there retailers again.  There are several courier companies who offer superior services, and i am happy to pay a little extra to have a basic level of customer service, and to not be threatened on my own doorstep.
I have used Booking.com several times and find it very user friendly and i have always been satisfied with the price and service provided.
Website is very shiny and slick (as with the shops), but it all feels a bit put-on, like they are going for sophistication, but just missing it.  They give the impression of exclusivity, but at the same time it is so common.  Coffee is ok, but very expensive.  I drink my way though about €300 Euros worth a year, and that's only having a couple a day.  The delivery is generally good, although the recycling service is a bit hit and miss (sometimes the delivery company take it sometimes they won't).  It's a pain that you can't buy it at the supermarket or somewhere similar though.  I have enough to plan without having to plan to buy coffee.
Where to start?  The website is terrible.  Now when i want to check the price of flights have have to click the box to agree to the terms and conditions first and then i need to fill in the security code, and finally i get the prices, which, of course, are not the final prices.  I then need to deselect everything i don't want (instead of just selecting the services i do), sometimes even needing to confirm that i don't want it in a confusing double negative way.  And, assuming i get through the whole process of rejecting all the junk they are trying to make me take without realising, i then have the privilege of paying an astronomical fee (around 20 Euros per return flight i think) to actually give them money.  Hidden costs left, right and centre and if you don't live by the letter of the law (Ryanair's conditions) then guess what, it's going to cost you, lots.  Customer service sucks as well.  The only positive thing i can say is that sometimes, and i really mean sometimes, flights can be reasonably cheap, but i would still rather pay a little extra, fly with someone else, and get where i'm going with a smile on my face.
Use Easyjet website quite a bit and find it simple and clear (compared to some other budget airlines).  The having to say no i don't want things is irritating (surely i should choose the things i do want) as is the hidden fees (why i should i pay to give them my money?), although these aren't as bad as other budget airlines.  If you can fly non-budget for a similar price (check it out - you often can, with more flexability, and without the herded cattle feeling -i find KLM to be very competitive for the routes i use regularly) then do it but otherwise Easyjet is an acceptable experience.
Generally a good website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally delivery is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal delivery), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong. My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.
I use idealo.de for flights almost every week.  The website is clear and user friendly and works well.  Prices are always among the best to be found on the internet.  Only three small modifications i would like to see:- 1) A feature to select date ranges to find cheapest flights (for a long weekend break i can often take the Thurs/Fri free or the Mon/Tues or the Fri/Mon so would like to see which is more economical without individually checking all options). 2) A feature to select specific dates but leave the destination blank, or at least cut the destination down to the individual regions/continents (often i know when i have holidays but have no idea where i would like to go and would like inspiration). 3) Some of the prices on the website do not correlate with the websites on which they are being sold.  This appears to not to lie with idealo.de, but with the other websites (because it seems to be the same few) but it is still frustrating.
Use KLM about once a month and find it to be generally a pleasant experience.  The website works well, although prices can often be expensive compared to other websites.  No hidden costs which is refreshing for airlines nowadays.
The Arguscarhire website is easy to navigate and quickly provides an overview of available cars.   The only negative was that the car model I selected was not even in the fleet of the rental company and I had to accept an alternative.  [ I realize this is not the responsibility of argus but they might check these things ]
Did some shopping at Country Attire; i was very pleased about the Barbour offers. They sell a large collection; have a stock notification and award points to your purchases. A good shop to come back
Very happy to have found LensOn.  It was simple to place my order and the lenses arrived a couple of days later.
they do just everything they say they do on the site, on time delivery, time, date as you wish. everything was due to our satisfaction. thank you for that.
i really liked the clothes i got and so fast
ik ben net begonnen met het gebruik van de argan olie en je merk nu al verbetering.
We had a problem with the owner of a booked appartment about the price. Booking.com helped us to try to reach for an agreement.. Last but not least they offered us a super alternative for the same price. Excellent contact by phone and email. Very friendly and understanding staff.
De on line shop en levering is net zo goed als in de winkel echt perfect.
Great clothing, a little expense, but you get great quality and free shipping. Often new collections, so they keep you interested. The only real downside for me is that they are located in Australia, and I am in the Netherlands. Customs can get very high.
They make time for questions or of you have à problem, they quickly respond. The delivery ia fast, it takes 3 work days it ship to the Netherlands. Nice prices on the goggles also.
The car we rented at Malaga airport was excellent! Brandnew, clean, diesel, nothing to complain about. Rates are reasonable and competative. The only issue are the waiting times for services. When we picked up the car at Malaga airport the waiting time was just over an hour and upon return (when you have a flight to catch) > 20 minutes. No inspection on return, so hope it works out fine with the deposit. Take care you have to return a car with an empty tank at Goldcar.
Made a couple of orders from Belgium, always received products  very quickly and in excellent condition.  Looking forward to make another order :-) A very pleased Belgian customer
never had trouble with direct ferries.always the cheapest.keep it up direct ferries.
easy to order,arrived on time.good value for money and done it all inside my house as it was snowing/cold outside.lol.
On March 15th I booked a car in Uruguay through BookingGroup. The site was easy to work with and the car-rental company had a car ready when we arrived there the next day. If I use this company again  I would be careful to thoroughly check the information about price because figures are not consistent between website, confirmation email and voucher, and the credit card transaction. I didn't print the original webpage with the figures and cannot be sure that I have paid what I expected in the end. The rental conditions do not state what happens if you return the car earlier. We rented for 10days and intended to drop-off at a different location. In the end we returned at earlier at the same pick-up location, but the rental company refused to reimburse 'because it is an international booking'.
cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
thanks again to PF Jones for the extremely rapid service and quick delivery. Good price for delivery to Belgium for 30 pounds compared to the weight of the towbar(20kg)
Volgende dag had ik het product in huis,veilig en perfect dus.
If you need a special pen for a good price via the internet this is the place to be
Perfect service and good answers of my questions. I live in the Netherlands and ordered some camera's. When they arrived the adapters were uk instead of EU. When i mail about it i get very fast an answer and i get right EU adapters. So realy perfect service! The equipement is also perfect and i am very happy with it.
Its like nothing I've ever experienced in any other shop. Fast, accurate and with a good price. Those guys are experts, fun to be with and their coffee tastes great. Its a must see shop, if you have the chance, go pay them a visit and see how cool they are for yourself. Thanks for a job well done. You are the best.
Very good quality leather items and easy purchasing online and last but not least, arrived in Amsterdam within a week! Really great. Thanks!
Ben erg tevreden over de service en hoop echt nog een x weer te bestellen
I`d looked on the website of a ferry company Id previously used, but the trip was really expensive, especially when I only needed to be away for a couple of days. When I looked at the direct ferries site, there were two other options suggested, one of which I hadn`t even been aware of - and that`s the one I eventually took! One click got me into the booking process, and I had my confirmation within a couple of minutes. Easy! (And I saved a lot of money!)
eBay is still evolving as even though it has been such a great marketplace for years. The merchant review system was revolutionary and creates trust in the seller which is essential is this kind of business. If only all the shady resellers could be weeded out...
Booked a hotel in Hong Kong this week: prices were substantially lower compared to other booking sites. However on the site I wasn't able to filter my search results by price :s All in all I was satisfied with the website and their service! Good stuff!
Ordered some small gifts to give away as Christmas presents. Had some trouble with the credit card payment: it needed a lot of confirmation/proff from my side but it is all for the better to make sure you don't get screwed over on ur creditcard bills. Had a helpful customer service representative who was responsive and to the point. Received my samurai chopsticks and fish eye lens only a few days later! However the packages of the items were kind of crushed and dirty. Other than that not real complaints!
Amazon.co.uk recently increased shipping costs to Europe. This was communicated in the most impersonal arrogant way possible. There was no response to complaints that followed.
Support non existent, key still not received. Luckily I paid with Paypal so I can start a dispute to get my money back. Avoid this company at all costs, there are plenty of stores out there that are trustworthy.
I just want to let you know that shopping at boohoo.com, receiving all the wonderful quality items and even returning something (with pain in my heart ;) is like a warm bath!!! I will recommend this store to EVERYONE I know!!! I ♥ Boohoo.com
I can recomment this company to anybody. Nice gadgets, good price/quality, quick responds and on time delivery.
The service was great and it was easy to discover all great attractions of London. That all for a fair price. Only the end station of the blue line was not very clear visible.
ordered a code and it was emailed within a few seconds perfect service and will buy there again also great that i could pay with ideal !!
Real good service from banggood , ordered first time, but certainly not the last time , goods delivered with free shipping and questions to customer support were answered real fast according to other companies i ordered from ! Way to go banggood!
The order was delivered within a few days although I was informed that delivery could take longer as they were in a warehouse move at the time of order. Delivered goods corresponded to my wish and fitted perfectly. A good reason to continu to order again in the future and to recommend Brandos to my friends. With kind regards,
I am really surprised because my shoes are untill today not om my adress in rotterdam
This company offers very good service, they were very helpful. They also answered my e-mail very fast and the items I ordered arrived very fast. Thank you for the service!
great service, great quality, website looking good with lots of goods
Dear friend, The registering goes very smoothly. The inbuild review mechanism garantees quality. I hope wimdu can keep up the high standard they have now combined of course with the relatively low prizes. As it is now I foresee  a lot more deals with wimdu in the future for me. GBW
I was very satified about the flight and the service. Next flight will be with you again!
The handling of the reservation (on line) was efficient and quick. The rates seem to be quite reasonable. Despite "or similar" phrase, we got exactly the type of car we reserved (which in most cases is not the case regarding rental cars). Pick up and drop off were reasonably efficient as well. One thing we consider not client friendly is the obligatory prepaid fuel (client to deliver the car with an empty tank). Most client would prefer to pay the gas himself and deliver the car with a full gas tank.
We received the tickets for the concert of Maroon 5 as promised and on time. We had no issues, we had access to the concert as promised.
My eyelaser surgery went absolutely fine. For the appointments before the surgery I had to wait >30 minutes a couple of times, that is why I gave 4 stars, but from that moment on everything went perfect. I had a great day with the surgery and the results are amazing. My sight is perfect now, they did very well. The checkups afterwards were taken care of by very friendly personnel as wel. Thanks a lot!
We got a really good deal with the new york pass. It was very easy to collect and use for the various new york attractions. And also a lot cheaper than buying seperate tickets for everything.
De levering was er snel en was zoals ik besteld had
This is the second time I order with CosmisCowboys and I can only say that it was very pleasant.
I am pleased with the product. I used Kiala as delivery method and arrived in 4 days. Everything in order.
We booked a Fiat 500 to pick up at Gran Canaria Airport. I think they did not have one at that moment so we got a Fiat 500 Cabrio for the same price. Super!
In the past I bought FIFA coins, which were almost instantly deliverd. Today I finally was able to buy BF4 and why not buy it from the fastest and the most reliable CDkeys website: MMOGA.com. So I did, payment went smooth and the CDKey got delivered within 5 mins. I will recommend this to friend so they know where to buy cheap and reliable keys in the future!
You guys are doing a great job! Your reviews made me do it to unlock my iPhone by your company. Within a few hours the iPhone was unlocked for a reasonable price! No difficult jailbreak or Gevey sim. This is the safest place for iPhone unlocks. May thanks from Holland!
Everything was good and fast, especially bringing the car back was very smooth and a transfer to the terminal was ready for us. We got a car from Dollar rent a car. Two remarks: The car we ordered was not available and the 'similar' car was just a little bit less, I was expecting something like this and off course they suggested an upgrade for 15 dollar a day, we eventually got it for 10 a day, but still, they should have had the car we ordered or a better car without paying extra. We got a full tank with petrol and had to bring it back empty, this is inconvenient and off course not possible so you will loose money here to.
Not expensive, good selection for all occasions. I ordered it on Saturday at 14:42, it got delivered same day. I don't know how they did it.... don't care.. but they did it ! same day delivery. I will definitely use it again.
Rentalcars' site offers a good overview of all the cars and it's easy to make a selection on car type. Booking a car goes fast, and in my case picking up / dropping the car went fast as well. The BMW 520 touring instead of the Passat was a nice extra from Thrifty. All in all a good experience that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat.
I'm happy with the order I placed at eflorist.co.uk. It was delivered in time and the ordering process went smoothly. It would be nice if I would have received an email once the flowers were delivered, but it took only a phone call with a very kind operator to get this confirmed. I guess that if you make an account you will be able to see the order status online.
de service en de  levering is prima en heel snel ook de prijs is voordelig ik ben heel tevreden !
the only website you'll ever have to go to if you want a good deal on ferry tickets
Wanted to buy an item that was not on stock, as I could see on the website. After I sent an e-mail, there was a quick response. Everything went as promised. Item arrived in perfect condition right on time. Received several mails so I could follow the status of the item. Perfect, recommended seller !

Ordered from Book-depository because Amazon doesn't accept pay-pal. Price was quite good (bought two of the Andrew Loomis books. A long dream come true) and delivery-time was set at 7-10 work days, which I figured shouldn't be a problem. Ordered on April 11. Book 1 was dispatched on April 12. Book 2 on April 14. Both arrived together on April 24th. Total: 9 work days. So delivered as promised, though a tough service for those lacking patience ( which would be me, in this particular case). Books were packed separately in close fitting cardboard packages, which was enough to keep them in good quality. Would order there again. Only drawback as far as I'm concerned is that they seem rather eager with the frequency of their email newsletters which means I've already unsubscribed from those.
Last week I fell through my bed 3 times within a single night... (well, 2 times to be honest. The 3rd time it was my GF, and since I was sleeping like a babe and never even woke up to notice her cursing and moving to the sofa, I can't really complain about that one ;) Anyway. Turns out the slatted bed base wasn't broken, but simply shifted between the sides and fell down through the opening. Since the bed had been incresingly squeekish ever since I moved from my old apartment I decided to check the screws to see if they were still alright... Imagine my suprise when I found that half of the screws were not there! Suddenly I felt very lucky that I hadn't completely ruined the bed in the last months (moral of the story... If your little brother says "Go take care of the dishwasher...I'll set up the bed by myself, no problem!" Make sure he doesn't discard half the screws and uses tie-wraps instead because he finds it quicker...) After checking my supplies I found a breadbag with most of the screws and several other missing parts I never even knew existed, but in the end I still came up short on a few of those long typical IKEA screws... Since the bed was over 10 years old and was no longer sold by Ikea, I feared I was screwed (yes... pun intended. Shame on me) But I decided to contact them anyway to see if I could buy them somehow. I was very glad that all they needed was the amount of screws I needed and the screw id-number, - I found this in a manual online- and they would send it to me free of charge. Five days later I received the screws in a giftbag with a complete Customs Declaration. Origin; Sweden. With them I was able to fix my bed, and what do you know... It hasn't squeeked once since. Nice service!
Vlotte levering van de spullen en ook wat ik er van had verwacht.
I was so impressed with the quality of service and friendliness of the staff' My order was shipped on a Monday to the south of Holland and I received it before 9 a.m. on the Wednesday! Fantasic delivery service.
My order was received within a timely manner and everything was packaged in a hard cardboard envelope that ensured that my NFC tags didn't get damaged.
Needed to buy some books that were only available on the Japanese Amazon website. Was hesitant at first to buy all the way from Japan, but everything went as smooth as with Amazon.co.uk. Very fast, albeit expensive, shipping. There's an option to show parts of the website in English. Altogether, perfect experience and very happy with the special books.
very nice strings for a good price and fast delivery I'll be back
Fast and reliable and not to forget, beautiful products! Thank you for sending my items so quickly!
Ordered a Sony PMW-EX1R and a Sachtler tripod at Video Data, contacted them in English, even though it's a German shop: they helped me very good and paid by bank. Next day the payment had arrived, so Video Data sent the camera and tripod in two separate packages: for no extra charge! Next day the packages arrived, in Holland; in one working day. Very happy with this store!
glad i discovered it great shipping price and product prices!
Rented a car via internet and picked it up at Bologna Airport. Car was great, we received a brand new (only 8k km on it) Lancia Ypsilon, but to registrate it took us almost 1.5 hours including waiting time in line at the desk of Gold Car. That is ridiculous, how difficult can it be to registrate 5 car rentals in that period of time (4-5 people in line in front of us), certainly when lots of data have been entered by myself while booking the reservation via internet ? They should make that process much more efficient, or add more staff. There was only one Gold Car employee working at that moment, she complained about it too...
Menlook offers a wide selection of designers and also feature key items of every collection. The order handling is informative and the delivery is just as you might expect from a good e-tailer, it's fast.
I have purchased about 5-6 games here, all i can say is EXCELLENT. The keys are delivered directly to the mail account after the payment has been received. also you will get a loyalty reward for waiting time if there is a delay. Last time i had a small problem where the payment was not completed by paypal where I had to wait almost 2 weeks for a game. When i contacted the customer service, all my questions were answered and helped alot to get the payment solved. The main two things which i love in this company are the services they provide and the prices they offer. Really glad i have found cdkeyhouse.com. I will keep paying and stay a big fan of cdkeyhouse.com.
Delivered the order as expected. However, no track and traceability was available on the sent package.
Indeed cheap.. and most of the times I get the shipment in about 3 weeks. Faster would be better but the shipment is free so I can't really complain about it. Packaging is sufficient. Safe enough for the products. I hold back on buying more expensive items on there though. One time I ordered something a little higher priced and I did not see it yet... got shipped but got 'lost' in customs..!?!
Good & Fast delivery. Only remark: package was damaged but maybe the Royal (!!) Mail or custom guys should be a little bit less curious or gentle !?
Awesome collection of the latest street wear. Great for Nessy people who want to show off their swagger at an affordable price! Me likey!
prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima prima
Amazing service and follow up! Although it took over 3 months to get the material delivered, of which I was made aware during the ordering process, I received frequently mails on the order status. The article was delivered in the time frame they predicted at the ordering process. Well done! The parcel was well received and especially the card in it that it was packed by - I believe - Jim, made it very personally!
Paddock communicates correctly and delivers your product very fast. The shipping costs to the Netherlands are very reasonable. I can recommend this firm to other Landrover enthousiasts.
The delivery was very fast. Although I did not receive the shampoo I ordered. I ordered Guhl shampoo amandel and I got the new version they just made. I am allergic to it, and I believed that they still sold the old version on this page, since that was what they said. I contacted them and ended up not having to pay to have it send back, which I am of course very satisfied with.
My experience with boohoo was really good and I would order from there again. The sizing is a little small with some items and the skirts are really short. But I think that also has to do with my height and my bodyshape, so that's not really something I can complain about. The delivery was quick. I received my package in less than a week, so that's really nice. I see a lot of negative reviews about the delivery but I think that has to do with your own post/mailservice and in which country you live. It's normal that it takes about 3 weeks to arrive if you live in the us. It's a UK based company. Overall I'm really happy with boohoo and will gladly order from there again in the future.
Handling my request was superb, and fast. Also I had some questions about registering to the site ,and my questions were very well handled by Mandy. Site looks awesome too, and lots of product.
The Piel Frama flip case was delivered according to schedule. The quality is excellent. One can see it's been hand made. However the design is not perfect if one uses an extended battery pack. Furthermore, the phone is not really lock in the case, when opened. When closed, it is protected really well though. And it smells lovely.
I always go to PureFormulas.com for specific brands -- they carry my favorite brands (Advanced Naturals amongst them) at a competitive price and no shipping costs. They ship fast and my products arrive in no time, all in good order. Thank you!
I would reccomend this site to all my friends. It's a userfriendly site with great products, friendly prices and fast delivery. My favorite for future orders definitely!
I"m very pleased with the service and ordered twice at Muubaa. The collection is beautiful and changes with the seasons. I'm a happy customer and would reccomend this site to friends and family.
ik hoop dat het medicijn ook helpt, maar dat weet ik pas over een dag of tien
first when i saw this site i wanted to know if it`s reliable. so i just tried. i bought fifa 14 and the next morning on the release i got my key :) :) In the future i will buy more keys from this site :)
Ordered batteries worth 30 dollars.. I paid, but they said I didnt. Had to file a claim with Paypal to get my money back. I will never order from this website again.
I ordered a Ted Lapidus DH51035N bracelet (464105) and within 1 month of wearing it the logo dropped of. They are now repairing it, which is a good thing. However, I have 0 confidence in the quality of this €100 bracelet and would rather have my money back but they refuse to do that. I thought a 100€ bracelet would also mean more quality, but this is just crap. Basicly I  wasted 100 euro's. Update: Since I had to send the item back, it had cost me €9,50 because I did not get an email they would have the mailcompany (TNT Express) call me. I emailed TicTacTime and they said they would refund this money. After that they said they would refund me a discount for the discomfort I am going through with this 100 euro bracelet. I asked how much this would be and in response they said this would be the €9,50 packagecosts. Are you serious? Thats not a discount, that is refunding mailcosts. Update: 3 Months later. I am still waiting for my product worth 100 euro's.. no response and nobody seems to care. I will never ever buy from this company again and I will advise everyone not to do so.
When I bought diablo 3 I was under the assumption that I had the global EU version, even for that price. But instead, what I got was a russian limited version where I can only play in russian. Now I have to buy a new gamecode to be able to play the game in English. I have contacted the website but no response yet and Paypal refuses to help me.
I bought a Sony DSC-RX1 camera from rhinocamera.nl for EURO 1.989,- which is about € 1.000,- cheaper than elsewhere on the internet. There are some issues which buyers need to be aware of: Rhinocamera needs to upgrade their logistics and invoicing to give the buyer a good insight in the processing of the purchase. Despite these glitches, I'm very satisfied with this camera. Jan de Boer - Holland
Ordered three Cleveland wedges and titleist hybride. All to my specs delivered in perfect shape in 1,5 week. Even got price adjusted when I found the wedges three pounds cheaper at other website. Only small comment is that it is not clear before ordering how quick the clubs can be delivered this depends on delivery from the manufacturer.
Tuxedo has a good service. when you call with a question. And also if you want to return a product, the are very flexible. Good job and if i need something i will always order at Tuxedo
I have orderd from Holland nine or ten times during the last two years. Never had any problem. The only time a machine arrived with damage it was solved perfectly.
I was doubting whether my size was all right or not. The package arrived very soon, all the way from Germany and they fitted perfectly. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I should order, I've read some bad comments, but it turned out to be perfect! I'm happy with my Nike roshe runs! :)
De website is makkelijk en overzichtelijk. De kwaliteit is prima en de levering was snel en probleemloos.
I had a problem. I had to sent a present from the Netherlands to Australie. I was really desperate, till a found Babycare. And ........ the delivery was in a week. So, I'm happy and my pregnant daughter too.
Simply CD Keys is a much cheaper alternative to Microsoft to buy MS Points and XBox Live Gold suscriptions. Easy payment (they accept Paypal) and super fast response; I had the code emailed directly to me in a couple of minutes. Perfect!
First of all, I'd like to apologize for writing my review in english. I'm a spanish customer and I can't talk dutch. A-10 Cyclone is, with no doubt, one of the most exquisit, state-of-the-art masturbators for men on market. Crystal Clear cup just lets you try another intensity and sensation. A must have.
Ordered, paid, received promptly. Nice to find a good service that is willing to ship abroad. Thanks!
CSJ CD Keys has a good supportservice, the prices are O.K. I found the anti-fraudcheck for new customers to difficult, but it proves that CSJ CDkeys can be trusted.
This was my first time ordering something from online and from that far (Australia-Netherlands) so I was quite nervous as to how long it would actually take for my package to arrive. To my surprise I got it way earlier then expected, very big pluspoint ánd my clothes fit absolutely perfect and are very nice quality. Very happy about my order and will definetly order again :)
Quite easy to book an insurance, One of the cheapest on internet and far cheaper than the insurances offered by rental companies. Can't say anything about the services if you need the and hope it will stay this way ;-)
I'bought a voucher for the evening tour but on the night itself it was really foul weather so...I didn't go. So maybe next time London by night can wait. Regards, Joost
If you don't want to spend much, you can grab some nice stuff from dressforless.nl. Keep an eye on their site and you will not be disappointed. The Customer Team provide good service.
I was a bit late ordering but very pleased my delivery was there in 2 days
I ordered a pair of boots from Mastershoe and despite the snow it arrived within 3 days. Very pleased!
I have ordered for the first time and eventhough it was the week before Xmas, we had our products delivered in 4 days. and I have saved about 30% or what I normally pay through my vets.
We chose the free of charge delivery and didn't expect it for at least a week but the order was delivered in 4 working days. Very pleased!
The payment, delivery and description of the products is concrete, informative and yet easy and quick to use and understand.
I ask for a private taxi and did get NOT a private taxi but a bus taxi for many other people and many stops and waiting, i payed before , but did only get back 25 % of my money
After purchasing 1 key for BF4 I also wanted to buy a key for a friend. Althought the first transaction went ok (had to confirm my paypal email and recieve a telephone call) I now had to provide copies of my id and credit card? Because I didn't have them at hand I decided to do it later even thought the payment with paypal had already taken place (would have been nice if CJS had waited with the transaction). But before I could send them the id and cc copies (all personal info remove ofc as instructed) I recieved the key anyway. Odd, but okay. Then a collegue wanted me to order him a key (he didn't have paypal). Again the request for more details came but this time for real. So I sent it, without any details to identify I was who I said I was (as sort of requested) and soon after I was allowed to collect my key. Which was by then sold out... So I had to keep track of the availability all afternoon and evening for my collegue until I was able to collect my key 6+ hours later. So although they deliver what they promise, the process is not without problems.
For the first time I bought a 36 bar windchime set and it is delivered in the expecting time, thoroughly packed. I'm delighted about the quality and I am very content about gear4music!
Alamo rentals deliver what they promise at a sensible price. I had hired a small car as I was only ever going to have one passenger. I was kindly offered an upgrade but opted for the most economical solution. Great little car - Hyundai i10. Much more power than you would imagine, great all-round vision and HUGE rear doors! Luggage space minimal though.
Zoover linked me to the site of Olotels. I was real surprised that the price via Olotels for the hotel that i want to book cheaper was than a direct booking to the hotel. Next time when I need a hotel it will be always via Olotels.
After reading all the bad reviews, I was a little in doubt wherer to order, but the watch I liked had a very good saleprice, so I took the chance. I ordered a Seiko on tuesday and it arrived on friday in the Netherlands. I am very happy with the watch, the fast shipping and the price!
The article I ordered was listed as 'In backorder', but was still shipped earlier than I expected. Pity Selectvracht made a sorting error afterwards, but I would recommend 12Game.com to anyone!
I am very happy with this product. I bought +- a year ago a product called Sin Bra. That was devastating for my skin. Now I tried it again after a small email conversation with this company. The products arrived a few days later and I tried them on that weekend during a party. They stayed put all evening!!! A perfect solution for a backless or strapless bra. I was also happy that the package was sent without a sign that it is an adhesive breast lift - discreet.
De bestelling was na een dag al binnen en ik ben zeer tevreden over het product
I'm extremely pleased with the silvermountain.nl. I've used their service several times and can only give them top notch reviews. They are very professional and always answer any kind of questions I have concerning deliveries etc. Packages have been sent to Sweden with UPS in a very timely manner each time. A+!
Really bad service from Jago24. I never got any response to my emails and orders. No communication. Unfortunately I already paid (and apparently too much) for the goods, but until now (one week), never received the goods, nor was there any email answer from Jago on my questions. As I see now... I am not the only one with this Jago24-experience. I hope other potential buyers don't make the same mistake.
I found the booking process of Easytobook very clear and simple. Unlike some competitors prices in your basket are shown including taxes and fees, so no nasty financial surprises when checking in at your hotel. Do note, that only prices in the basket are including taxes & fees. Everywhere else, like on the search results page, are excluding taxes & fees (which is clearly noted). A small, but important detail. It could be more clear if prices on the search results page would also be including prices & fees, but this might be part of a price perception strategy (who knows?). One other thing I also liked were the hotel detail pages. They give an immediate impression of the hotel. The 360 degrees panoramas are a nice touch in this aspect. Further all details/conditions are always displayed, for those who'd liked to read the small letters. I can't give feedback on customer support as I didn't need it yet, which I might see as a good sign. When looking for accommodation in the future, I'll be sure to include Easytobook in my search!
I have been to London several times now but every time I visit this beautiful city with someone who doesn't know London that well, I take the Big Bus Tour. And really I'm enjoying it time and time again. I won't get bored at all. Perfect service, reservations easy en simple, nice and helpfull staff, in short it's super for me!!
I've once won a discount-code for a tablet-sleeve on a Facebook campaign. A few months later I decided what sleeve I wanted and I went to the website of EGOsketch. The website is very user-friendly and helps you trough the steps of personalizing your sleeve. After walking trough all steps I placed my order and 2 days later the sleeve arrived. This is where my only drawback was: the package which the sleeve was sent in was damaged and half opened. But overall the sleeve itself was perfect in condition and the quality is very high of the sleeve. Thick fabric and a sharp printed image. Great job EGOsketch!
I've ordered many, many photobooks. Every year of my children gets a seperate photobook and we have 3 kids. I was hoping that I would be less expensive, but quality is nice.
I'm from Holland and ordered some clothes from boohoo.com. But there is a lot of difference in the sizes. On other sites in England i wear always size 14, but at boohoo.com 2 of the 3 doesn't fit. So, i must send it back, but they wanted a track code. So, the shipping costs were 13 euro! The one i hold is very nice!
Ordered my 2 cables on Wednesday from kenable.co.uk and they were delivered at my home in the Netherlands on Monday! Perfect !
Thanks for the security and keep up the good work
I by for years now, machines from Makita and hand-tools. When I need something I first look at Toolstop and than look elsewhere to find it cheaper. Almost every-time I by at Toolstop. It is the shipping cost to Belgium that sometimes make the difference. I recommend the site to everyone I talk to and  whom needs tools. Toolstop Highly recommended
I'm from the Netherlands and customer since 2008! I'm a big fan of BeautyBay.com because they have a lot of Sebastian products I use and they are very cheap. They have a very quick delivery to the Netherlands. Happy!
I'm very happy with the host that accepted us, but it took a while to get to her. I had to contact a few others before her, as their pages showed they were available, which they turned out not to be. This was a bit annoying, because I had very little time left to book a room. The host I have now seems great, she got in touch very quickly and was happy to answer all our questions.
booked villa in Haines City for 2+ weeks. Property was as advertised and had a great time in Florida. Booking through this site also gives secure feeling that everything will be ok.
We were looking for something special for our daughter's wedding. Someone pointed us to Mymoza. And it was a smashing success. Great service btw. I was called to let me know the main picture could be zoomed in a bit more. We kept changing it until it was exactly right.
omdat het om een roos in een vaas ging was het wel jammer dat de roos kapot was
Punt ter verbetering is de mogelijkheid om op de website de status van de order te bekijken.
it was possible to buy at a cheaper price elswere
Cicar understands what car renters need: a good car, speedy transactions and no hidden 'surprises'. After minimal waiting time it was our turn to get our rental car. They only needed to make copies of our driver's licenses. After paying the agreed price, we were presented with the car keys, booster seat, map and free CD about Lanzarote and off we went. The car was in very good condition. Returning the car went very fast: we parked, returned the keys and that was it. No hassle, no long conversations, no large forms to fill out. And that leaves us more time to catch our plane. Next time, we'll go with Cicar again!
I was happy with my order on Boohoo.com. I picked a few items that were on sale because I'm a poor student, but luckily there's a lot of choice, even in the sale category. It's a good place to look for clothing that's a little different than what I find in stores, for a good price usually. My friend had some trouble with a pair of jeans - she's a size 6 but when the jeans came she got them up to her knees and then they were stuck. Ordering a sizer bigger than you usually wear seems to be a golden rule! Also, I'm a little annoyed by all the crop tops and clothes that only look good on thin models, but if you can see past those, it's a good site to get stuff and I'm definitely coming back :)
I had a problem with reaching the download area. But within 2 minutes i was in. This is the second time and it's again the same service. Keep on the good work.
I ordered with express shipment, but received the order 5 days later as expected. Don't know whose to blame,  but after i contacted Wiggle i was given the choice to get a refund or a voucher for the cost charged for the express shipment. That's what i call good service. In the future i will surely order with them again.
The cheapest shop i could find selling the GoPro. Ordered it on Tuesday, delivered on Friday in the same week from HongKong to Holland Great service
I had an issue with my order saying that it was unsuccessful. I immediately sent a ticket to the customer service, and i got a reply next day, saying that my order was on it's way and i need nothing to worry about. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to fix the problem in no time. So for the awesome service and the reassurance, I thank you very much. Renata
My parcel hasn't been delivered. I contaced Boohoo several times, and they answered me once. They offered to help me plan a new delivery date, so I told them it would be great if they did that, but I haven't heard from them since.
ik had het echt de volgende dag in huis en alles zo als ik het had besteld
HouseTrip is a good place to start looking for a nice house or appartment for you holiday. It's good value for money and the service is quick and friendly. I allready stayed with House Trip in 3 different locations and it was always up to expectations.
Been looking for a special remote for my JVC DAT recorder for over a year, even in Japan and the US. Then I found it on the Partmaster website, and ordered it straight away. It took a few days before I recieved it, but since I live in the Netherlands, I know this to be normal. After a week, it safely arrived. Excellent service and friendly customer service. I will be looking for parts at Partmaster again!
Collected, packed and shipped some items for me to be sent overseas. Great level of information during the various steps in the process, excellent packing and very helpful and responsive staff. Would recommend !
I ordered an item that I really looked forward to. After a few days it turned out it wasn't in stock. Really sad that the website and their stock didn't match. I learned that this has happened to a lot of customers. A real disappointment.
The flowers arrived on time, beautiful and fresh. The admin wasn't too bad and the note to say the flowers were about to/had been delivered was much appreciated.
I order at Heinnie, mostly for Maxpedition products. At Heinnie they are cheaper, than in my own country The Netherlands. With my last Maxpedition order, I also ordered some lightsticks. Just in-case you need light and your batteries are dead. Everything was fine, until I saw that the lightsticks are on the bottom of the package. Not protected at all! They're in a plastic-wrapping, so I can't see- until I try to use one- if they are OK or not. The plastic-sleeve notes you should only that the wrapping off, when you want to use the lightstick. This is the only bad I had with this order, the rest is perfect. I will certainly order at Heinnie again.
I am always looking for the best deals. And Etrip really helped me with that when I was looking for a hotel in Australia. Together with my family, I wanted to visit my sister downunder. Furthermore, the site also has this useful option to rent a car at the same page. I can assure you, it makes things a lot easier. Thanks Etrip!
Great product. Package was returned the first time. Don't know what the exact reason was, package was sent again, 3 days later I finally received my sneakers. It took 4 weeks after payment, but customer service was really helpful and friendly. I would order again.
I'm an absolute fan of apps for my Iphione and Ipad and Ipad mini but every time I visit the Itunes store (Netherlands)  I'm disappointed about the small choice, especially on games. I Hope they offer much more apps and games. I believe that tjere are much more (game-)apps available than showed in the store....And if more apps are available, I will absolutely pay for them, I'm not a fan of the (inferieur) free (game-) apps. And I see the Android business, phones and apps, are beginning to become more booming under my friends...
I almost always fly KLM, because they not only know what service is, but safety is the most important subject of training their crew and preparing their flights. I feel very confident, secure and relaxt flying KLM, so I'm a true fan and will recommend KLM to everyone!
My order was handled quickly. And every step of the way you are kept informed.
overall a nice and trustfull company, quick service and no long waiting times in the garage, top service for a acceptable price, good tyres all over.
Still waiting for the GRID key that I ordered the 29th of june. After asking when the key would be sent, CDKeysDiscount answered that there were problems with stolen keys and that they cey would be sent the next day. It's now july 5th and there still is no key to be found. A new message to them asking for clarification and an eventual refund goes unanswered. Opened a ticket with paypal to get my money back.
I ordered some swimwear at banglads.com. My order arrived very quickly, Unfortunatly it was a faulty product. After i send an e-mail about it, they send me a new one, and There was no need to send the faulty product back. So great and accurate service in my opinion! I would definitly recomend it to everyone
speedy delivery  as promised and advertised at website. only improvement cold be to provide tracking service also for international delivery
It's much cheaper than buying seperate tickets, you don't have to wait in a long queue to buy your ticket.
i'm really really happy with / DealExtreme.com simply cause i have a low budget and still i can order stuff i like, i can buy things i normally can not pay and the prices @ DX.com are perfectly fit for my wallet XD.. i'm so pleased that i can pay with paypal. they have a super great service desk that helps you kind and friendly, no weeks waiting for an answer, most of the time the same day... if there is something wrong with the order or something is not available they let you know real fast... can't help to say, super!!! and..... no shipping fee, its free of charge to get the products to my front door love that!if it was in my country, i would apply for a job :-)
Try to rent a house in Hotsprings Arkansas. Owner contacted us we had to Phone Cevin. So we did and he give us another telephonenr from the manager. Called again and she could not find our reservation. She asked for our mail and give us the mail to confirm the dates. The mail she gave was not working. So we phoned twice from The Netherlands and wait for her mail. That never arrived. Next day a mail from airnb the owner did not contact us and they canceld the reservation. Send Cevin the owner a mail and he didnt know whats going on and would contact his manager. Never got a nother mail from cevin (all in airnb account) again. Next day money is taken of the visa  and this happend again for four days. Contacted my visa and they have to block my creditcard. Try to contact airnb to warn them for the scam. After a few days a stupid response that the owner did not get in touch with them. Not even a word about the scam and taking this owner out. Luckly visa get my money back. So be warned dont use this site to book a house you might be scammed to.
Buyincoins is one of the cheapest Chinese shops. It's cheaper then other Chinese shops and that's nice! The customer service is very good, when you've a question. You got a answer the same day. Some Dutch online shops can learn from the Chinese shops. When Buyincoins send your package, you get a photo from the package. Buyincoins is the only Chinese shop that make a picture and that's very good!
When I buy something in China. I go first to Banggood.com. Banggood is more expensive then other Chinese shops. But the service is much better! When I've a problem, i get a good solution for my problem. Last time something was broken and I got money from Banggood for buying in my country!
the price is very good and the delivery is fast the only thing I missed was the delivery date i,ve got a mail that it was ready to sent to holland but no date, so when it came Ii was at work and mij friend who was just there at that time has to pick it up.
Searching for boots, I tried the internet and found boohoo.com with boots I was looking for. So I filed an order and within a few days the goods were delivered to me. Very good quality, prices and service! Fred (Netherlands)
My golfbag arrived about one week later than promised. They didn't respond  my emails. Quite annoying when you recieve promo-mailing daily from them on the other hand But for the rest everything was ok.
I travel a lot for my job and KLM.com is truly my online-agent for everything. Great service, great care, great reminders and as never before, they start valuing their frequent travelers. KLM.com, keep it up!
Vistaprint has great quality and a great variety on products. The deals are great as well!
direct na de bevestigingsmail werd er al gereageerd met een bod
A well put concise and well presented website. Fast and reliable service, a pleasure doing business with.
I read these reviews after I placed the order... otherwise, i think i wouldn't have ordered at all. But then, i got worried, would it be a scam??? No it wasn't, they delivered the goods to the Netherlands in 7 workdays. They didn't react to any of my mails, wich felt a bit disturbing, nor was the statusupdate switched to send/dispatched/shipped, wich wasn't really making me less worried. Conclusion, they do deliver, even within a reasonable time, but don't react to mails. Gr. Nick
De bezorging was lekker snel de pasta was erg lekker en de pizza's uiteraard ook
I bought a store brand longboard, they are pretty good quality and not expensive too! Delivery was super quick to the Netherlands.
I ordered a golf bag that was delivered to the Netherlands within a few days! Price quality is very good on bags and also on all other products! Great job
Finally I was able to order the chair of my dreams, the Eames Lounge Chair! Shipment was really fast and the quality of the product is above expectations. Edwin.
De prijs van het bestelde product is de laagste die op internet te vinden was
Ordered a pair of racing jackets on Sunday. package was at my home on wednesday. For an item sent from the UK, that's a fast delivery. Very well package also. No chance of damage on the way. Will certainly buy again from this site.
Bought a camelbak charge 2013 at the lowest price available on the net. When I ordered the bag I enjoyed a discount of 20% on top of the already low price. And within a few days the stuff was on my doormat. So, very recommendable.
I fell in love with the Quilted Biker the second I saw it! Besides being the best & the most perfect leather jacket ever, Boda Skins' service is outstanding! Blue helped me perfectly (replied very quick and answered all my questions) and now I'm the proud owner of the most amazing Boda jacket which fits me like a glove. I love it! I would recommend Boda Skins to everyone. I'm a fan, keep up the great work; you guys are amazing!
It was so fast, I payed my key and in 30 seconds I had my key in my inbox! One word A M A Z I N G !
Vistaprint offers high quality products - once you have navigated your way around the very irritating website! It's very reminiscent of airline ticketing  websites, what appears very reasonably priced initially, usually ends up doubling in price at the end! Throughout the ordering procedure you are constantly bombarded with advertising encouraging you to order more items. I would prefer to see all double/single cards separated, highly confusing jumble at the moment and very easy to make a mistake! One feature I did like was that you begin by uploading your chosen photo etc and that this image is shown immediately on all their products. And I was impressed with the helpful  advice when I contacted by phone the help centre.
I placed my order on 13/8 and it arrived on 15/8. Couldn't be faster than that could it?! The product I wanted was unavailable in two pet supply shops I tried, turned to internet and quickly arrived on the Pets Place website. I will certainly recommend this company to others.
My order wasn't delivered. They promised me to send me an replacement order. And when I ask about an status update they don't reply. I'm waiting on a reply for six workingdays now. Also they give me vouchers for one item from that order they couldn't deliver because it is out of stock instead of my money back. I've tried to solve this in a civilized way, but I've lost my patience now. I really don't trust this company and will not recommend anyone ordering from this webstore.
I live in the Netherlands and recently placed my first order with the BCS and since then am pleased to say I have received my goods all well shipped and neatly packed. I was happy to find everything in one piece and this made me pass my pleasant shopping experience on to my sister who in turn placed an order of her own.  BCS has a wide variety of goods to choose from and also offer supermarket deals and fair prices. I'm particularly chuffed to get magazines there too! Another plus in my view is the possibility to buy certain items in bulk. The site is clear, fast and easy to use plus the shipping costs (in my case) were wonderfully affordable so I will most certainly be visiting again soon....and so will my sister ;-)
Nice sequined jackets, especially ordered for a party my twin and me were hosting. A little tight under the arms for a sizeI 14 but that wasn't a problem. I was quite happy with the swift delivery but was appalled by the state the jackets were in as they had been srunched and crumpeld together in a small plastic bag. I know the p&p was free but still would have prefered to pay for shipping if it had meant the items get delivered in good shape.(in a box!!) Straitening (ironing) wasn't made easy as the sequins require careful handling.
ik bestel er al een tijdje , en de kwaliteit en service is goed
Recieved the new memory modules after 6 working days in Holland. I upgraded my MacBook and it took me only few minutes to have a nice quick start up.
Overall, my experience with Bluesuntree as quite high. I called customer support a few times to ensure item stock, and the person on the phone was very nice. Delivery was very prompt, even though we are in the Netherlands. However when I received my items, the quality was not as high as I expected. The seat I ordered had very loose screws, different types of screws (where they should be the same), and different screw hold sizes. I'm not sure if I will order from Bluesuntree again because of this.
I was browsing for a cheap Total War: Rome II (+DLC) deal. I had ordered with CJS in the past and was helped then as great as I was now. Swift delivery after payment and instant collecting of my keys which I added to Steam! In one word: Awesome!
I live in contiental Europe and have been a costumer of the BCS for about 5 years. I am very pleased with the service, my orders arrive within 4-5 days and the items are always carefully packaged. I regularly order tea, jam and sauses (in glass containers), and they always arrive intact, which is great. Another great thing is that you can track and trace your package so you always know when it will arrive. I rate BCS five stars for service! Product availability could be improved: the selection of products is quite good, but unfortunately my favorite brand is often unavailable so I have to order an alternative brand. But overall, Excellent!!
Bax Shop is the first place i look whenever I need audio equipment - really! In my experience, their prices are very reasonable, their product information is accurate, and their delivery times are remarkably fast. What more could i ask?!
Excellent service e quick results via Internet. This was the first time I used Ebookers and I am going to continue in this way,
Goods where refused because of a registration of MasterCard account and delivery address. Offer to pay goods by electronic banking, in advance of release, which had been accepted in the passed, where refused and order cancelled. Very disappointed.....
an easy to use website multiple payment methods (paypal, ideal) great discounts prety expensive
I ordered myself (first order) a camera lens at simply electronics. and the delivery was supposed to be within 8 days, so after 9 or 10 days I wrote an email to the customer services, they responded very quickly, adequate and friendly notifying me that my parcel had been sent the day before. As an extra service they (customers service employee Emma) would appreciate a notification if and when I recieved it. The price of the lens is unbeaten, and the service is good. The fee for packaging and delivery was included, so the price was superb!  A happy customer from The Netherlands
The order was send correctly and delivered in 7 days. All 4 remotes send to us where in working order and nicely packaged. Thanks for the quick and correct service.
The product itself was a bit more expensive than buying it in my own country, but I can't get it anywhere in my country without spending even more to get there, so I bought it anyway. Shipping costs were good, I could even pay with iDeal, excellent service! Order status was given on time and was accurate. I was a bit hesitant buying such a delicate product online and having it travel over seas, but it was very well packaged and arrived in mint condition. Would definitely recommend!
I ordered a Jack Wolfskin Unbound Jacket L Matisse blue, because in the Netherlands size L was not available at that time and Mctrek offered a very good price, about 100 euro less than the original price. Mctrek charged my creditcard in an not-to-understand manner. 131,- euro extra above the price for the jacket which was 158,- euro.  Three other articles they want to charged my creditcard with as well. They have sent me lady shoes instead. Sent shoes back to them a 12,50 shipping costs. They say that they will pay back the shipping costs but first wait until the shoes are returning to them. When I activated Eurolabel EHI and my Bank (ING) Mctrek took action. When I wanted to cancel it all, because after a week it was not clear if the jacket was available in the first place, Mctrek became a master in ignoring again. They read my emails half, are preoccupied with their own conviction. Never again, bad for the blood pressure and took a lot of energy to lead in good ways! Don’t understand how they can do everything wrong! At last they paid everything back including the shipping costs. One friendly contact person in the company I mention, T. Pieter, The Netherlands.
easy site to order, nice meterials, good colour of the water jug ! i would recommand to anyone to use this site and order product.
I had a flight from London to Frankfurt on friday 23th may at 7:25 PM. I booked a ticket via Cheaptickets. After I booked I saw that it was a charter British Airways / Airberlin. I arrived 30 minutes before departure and tried to checkin my bags. The checkin representative told me it was not possible to get that flight anymore. I asked him to change my flight to the next available, that was not possible as well because I needed to contact Airberlin via Cheaptickets. Now I had to pay 480 GBP for LHR - FRA and I already paid 300+ euro for that flight excluding a hotel. I am a frequent flyer and normally book KLM. KLM charges you 70 euro's for changing the ticket and you will get the first seat available for the next flight. I contacted both companies (Air berlin and Cheaptickets) but they are finger pointing to each other and British airlines. Thanks for the good service, I would recommend everybody to book a ticket directly by a n Airline company instead of an agency.
I am a returning customer and it is a pleasure to do business with Multicolour.com. The description of the gems is always very accurate, prices are good compared to the quality. Communication is very easy and customer service is high!
I use Albelli for my photographic portfolio books. The service in the past 12 months has reached an even higher standard than previous. The turn around time between ordering and recieving is great and the quality and finish is really excellent. I reccommend Albelli to all my friends.
Nice service and email response. wait a bit long for my products tho.
Very happy with my new shades that were sold out everywhere else.  Reasonable price and extremely fast shipping! I would certainly recommend this webshop to friends!
There are no real downsides to purchasing here. Everything goes instantly. The only time I had a problem, albeit a bit annoying due to sending multiple types of evidence, did get the job done within 15 hours.. I've done a lot of business here and will proceed to do so again. Highly recommended.
I have buyed a few days a go a key that was payed with PayPal but there was someting wrong with the paymend. now i have buyed a new one. and get the old one refound. You can say much but this is what a good company does. So you get 5 stars from me guys and again tnx for the support
Only few stores sell the Adonit Jot pro stylus. iPodhoes does and delivers fast as promised. Even in my case, very short before a well advertised period that shipping was suspended due to a move. The Adonit Jot pro stylus itself is a blast to use, aside from the ticking sound it makes. That is the price you have to pay for near perfection. Thanks to iPodhoes for selling it.
I've had the device a while now and i love it. Especially if you get a custom Rom on there if you have no use for the Chinese apps. It runs super smooth and every single app works without any lag. Furthermore the phone shipped all the way from China to The Netherlands in just a few days and merimobiles was helpful at answering my questions. I would recommend this device and this website to everyone that's looking for top of the line hardware and a fast and reliable service.
My wife and I were looking for some herbs to mix our own tea and found everything we wanted on Healthysupplies. Easy to order, quick delivery. We found it a bit pricey, but I'm not sure if any other place is cheaper, so I suppose the price is reasonable. Anyway, we're very happy with the herbs and with our tea!
The high duty clothing racks we bought are of excellent quality: very sturdy and they hold all our clothes as we use it instead of a wardrobe.
Do not expect any service when you don't get what you bargained for. If they tell you  to send it back so they can review the issue with the product and forward them the shipment proof of payment, don't believe them. As soon as you've sent the items and the proof of dispatch you get a reply stating that you will not be reimbursed because the items are not considered faulty. Very interesting as the return shipment hasn't even left the DHL facility in-country yet!
Tickets were issued only hours after ordering and payment and well before the event. which was already sold out and viagogo offered me a way to go . paid somewhat more than the original price but what the heck .. loved it !!
I bought a jacket for a great price and unfortunately it was damaged becouse of abnormal high pressure on the package during transport. Within 24 hours the service department (David) reacted on my e-mail and asked me which day I prefered an arranged pick up! They asked me also if I would have a refund or a new jacket. Ofcourse I choosed for a new jacket and within 3 workingdays I received it in a good shape. It was almost bulletproof packed :-) Becouse I already had sended the damaged jacket back on my own costs, they decided to credit the transportcosts I had made. Conclusion: Good prices, good aftersales department, great e-mail follow ups during the whole case. I would recommend this shop highly!!
I didn't received my order number FN7239903 after 10 days waiting. They also do not reply on emails I've send about the non-delivery. I never wil order again at this company because of the horrible customer service they have. Actualy I think they have no customer service at all! It feels like they stole my money. I would not recommend this company!!! Be aware!    They make me feel bad instead of unique :(
Recommended!! I was looking for some parts to 'pimp' my 6 years old Dell OptiPlex 745 and succeeded very well at MicroDream. Good quality products, great value for money and realistic shipping costs to the Netherlands. Will certainly buy at MicroDream again when the demand arises!
I came from the Netherlands to be at the funeral of my father. The staff reacted very well when I told them the purpose of my visit. The car was handed very fast and good. The car was what I expected. (I booked on line) The car was clean and it was a very good car. The staff that helped me was very kind and polite. If I going to visit my mother again I will get a car at Dollar again.
We used this company several times and were never disappointed. Paintings arrived on time or a little earlier than expected, delivered to our doorstep in the Netherlands with UPS. We received emails every few days, informing us about the status of our order and the paintings. When the paintings are ready - they send photos of the paintings to you by email so you can approve it for shipping or request modification. The website is beautiful and easy to use. We would not hesitate to use this this company in the future and we recommend it to all our friends and relatives. Keep up the good work! H. Morgan Den Haag (Hague)
chronic came true for me and Always answerd my emails where other probably would not great service well worth the price very happy
The order came on time, great value and was exactly as it appeared.  Would recommend the website to anyone who is looking for good value and service
Rockstar makes alot of fun games, but the bugs and glitches are to bad. GTA 4 is alot of fun but the times if been kicked from a server or out of gfwl is extreme. Still, I would have been happy dealing with the kicks but now my cd key has been blocked due to overuse. I have had to install and reinstall not only gta but also my windows oc serveral times due to problems with GTA 4 and now i have overused my key?
The best price for sunglasses that is for sure. Buying it over internet means trusting a company. I payed with paypal to be sure I would get my money back in case of not delivered or fake, since the price is so much cheaper than other webshops. After ordering and paying I got a confirmation email and that was it. Where was my tracking code? Fake company? No, I got a tracking code 2 days later. Good. Then my package was delivered quite fast, but given to my neigbours for me to pick it up. Ok fast delivered in the end, but where is the option Not! to deliver such a valuable package to others than myself? Good thing my band with the neigbours is ok, but what if it wasnt.. would I recommend sunglassesshop to others? Yes. I would also advice the buyer to fill in the extra field to tell sunglassesshop Not! To deliver to anyone else but the buyer. New feature for the ordering process?
Prices were more expensive than local sites and the flowers did not arrived on the agreed date. It is now unclear to me whether they arrived at all.  The email correspondence stopped after the first apologies and the promise to deliver them a day later. The flowers were for the 88th birthday of my grandma. Floraqueen never again!!!!!!!
The service offered by Mr Pen was great: price levels are fantastic, and delivery was super fast.  I will buy here again very soon!
After buying one thing over eBay, I have found the complete webshop and am very found of it. Great choice, nice offers.
We had no problems and we booked what we wanted
They take a long time to send the goods. I understand that they send from Germany and that transport may take some time, but they need a long time to prepare the package. They also do not deliver on Saturdays. Last package I ordered took 5 days to be delivered while they say 2-3 days on their site. I will not buy from Thomann anymore in the future. There are many stores that have 24 hrs delivery and that are also cheaper.
I ordered the Letherman and received a confermation mail with information about the way and time it wil take to ship the item to the Netherlands EU, after a fiew days instead of a fiew weeks I received the item in my mailbox. PERFECT
After 25 years something special was deserved! So a lovely, fitting bouquet of roses plus an orchid which is a favourite for my wife. Delivered as a 'secret' at our door on the day with my English greetings, this was excellent service. Knowing everything will be as you wish is a good comfort especially for such an occasion; therefore my thanks and appreciation.
Love the site and love the hostels offered. Booking is easy and responses fast. This is as good as that other site where you can book hotels!!
Well, this seems to be the number 1 reseller of onesies. Collection is big, delivery is flawless. What can I say?..Just grab your onesie and leave :)
I first started to make orders on yesstyle in 2012, never had issues, easy to order, super service with the over $25 that your items can be shipped for free. Lovely collections, for every season, so you really do have alot of choices. When an item wasn't availble or they couldn't get it stocked I get a message very quick and they paid me back real fast too. Just a real amazing company, I just hope I can visit the yesstyle store one day in San Francisco or San Jose!
I order a Filofax on Thursday, Friday I got a e-mail that my order was send to me. I received it on Tuesday. The order was send to The Netherlands. I was pretty suprise for the fast delivery. My filo is in perfect condition and was packed very nicely. Very happy with the service of Colemans!
very fast handling of my order. they did a graet job
Excellent service with quick to the point answers, even in the weekend
I ordered from this site twice- the first time one of the items I had ordered was missing and when I went to look on their site I couldn't find the item anymore. I took a look at my order information and it said I ordered the item but when I clicked on it to get to the item's page it just said it was out of stock. They probably didn't have the item anymore when I had already ordered and paid for it and decided to just ignore it and hope I didn't notice it or something. -.- Since it had only been a few dollars I decided not to take the time and trouble of trying to get my money back. I place a second order and this time it took eight weeks for my package to get here. I don't know what kind of postal service this business uses but I have ordered from so many other businesses in Asia before and it always takes abou two weeks for my items to get here. On their site it says maximum delivery time is four weeks, both times I ordered from them it took over six weeks. I was excited when I finally got my package but that faded when I opened the package and noticed they'd bent my Ipad screenprotectors to get them to fit into the too small box. The other few items were just some extra Iphone cases, the screenprotectors were the only things I really needed. Well, needless to say I couldn't use them and after waiting a total of 8 weeks for my package to arrive, I still had to go to a store here and buy another far too expensive screenprotector that'll only last for about a week.
easy to order and on time delivered, even to the continent.
Fastest delivery from UK to NL in 2 days! Good service and also fully satisfied about the product.
My shredder was broke the plate that pushes the twigs and branches to the rotating knife was completely broken. Orderder one some tome ago, but till now nothing appeared. Missing in expedition they call it......
First time I ordered here and there is nothing to complain about. I ordered it on sunday and received it tuesday. The only thing is that on the website it says today ordered tomorrow delivered. That doesn't work for sundays, I thought so already, but it doesn't said it.
You have a choice from the complete range of orginial Buffs. The shipping is superfast and low priced, petrol or the public transport will cost more money, so I'll be back.
No waiting in long lines, perfect. I would not take a card with public transport options. You just get 3 day tickets, and you have to buy a ticket for public transport to be able to get the card from their office.  Since the day tickets for public transport are not expensive and you have to buy one anyway to get to the place where you can pick up your london pass, i will just get them myself next time. But  the card itself sure was very handy! Was a bit disappointed that the hop-on  hop off busses were not included. That was the least i expected to be in the price. You can get a trip in the thames for free tho. We did not use the card a lot because it was excellent weather, so we did  not break even on it, but next time i am in London, i would order it again! Even if it is just to have no hustle at all! Prices of entrances are insanely high. Without the card we probably would have skipped most attractions due to long lines and high entrance prices.
From the Netherlands, i've a very good and very pleasant experience with Blaze Sunglasses, with the help of Paypal. The sunglasses within a week delivered at home,  for half the price in which, it was announced in shops around here. Thank you very much, for the great deal and delivery, if i ever need some glasses in the future, i'll return to them. With greatings, Richard Maijen
The tour definitely passes all the highlights, and we were lucky, it was quite quiet so it was almost as if we had a personal tour guide! Unfortunately it was really busy on the main roads (which is normal in NYC), so we had loads of red lights and traffic which meant that the tour took longer than was really necessary.
Products ordered were good, amounts correct and the shipping went well (good packed, no damage, fast delivery). Not good: each time after ordering a product for shipping to The Netherlands after a while I received an extra invoice for extra shipping costs. However when ordering, the country were it should be shipped to was already entered in the system, hence known and the shipping price for Europe/NL is calculated in the total price. So why do I still have to pay this additional amount and why is it not mentioned immediately?! The weight of the parcel is known when I order even. Also not good: I have received several emails with mentioning that next time I order I will receive a discount, one time for delays caused, one time because of an offer, but it is never ever calculated nor was it processed in my next order even when mentioned. When I phone them they tell you that they will process it in my next order, but that never happens.
Ordered an iPad on Monday 3 May, paid immediately and expected it to be shipped on Wednesday (usually ships in 1-2 business days), but the order status still says processing.....contacted them yesterday evening about this, no answer yet. Started to feel uncomfortable, did some research and that's how I found Trustpilot. Wish I checked them out before, I feel so stupid now. I truly hope I will receive my iPad soon. Will keep you posted. Update 7 May: they told me estimated despatch date is next Tuesday afternoon. Update 10 May: received an email today that said my order has been despatched. Update 12 May: received my order today and I'm delighted with my iPad.  Overall I can't really complain, delivery didn't take that long and Vanessa and Emma have been very helpful, they kept me informed all the way.
The ordering went quick and easy. The delivery and delivery notices were accurate but the only disadvantage was that the return cost at the post office were more than 14 euros.
A website that is easy to navigate, with design templates ready to download and use. Printing work was excellent. Would recommend.
I ordered 3 shirts and the delivery to the Netherlands was very quick, I received them within 1 week. One of the shirts is the Floral Skull Sublimation Tee. Which was my favorite shirt. After I have wased it, the print was almost disappeared. I now have a almost plain white shirt. So this is quite disappointed. The services is very good, but the quality of 1 shirt is very bad.
The website by Monnier Frères has a lovely collection, but the usability could be better. The deals are great, but I would expect a cheaper delivery fare for such expensive products. I do think it's great that returning items is free though. And the delivery can be super fast, like the first time I ordered something. Be the two times after it took much longer and I was not informed by MF unfortunately. I am not sure about the staff on the phone. They are not super friendly and are not very quick thinkers it seems. Sorry about that.
Its very easy very quick a great service very nice actions and very important very sweet fees,World Remit is the leader ofvthe world champions!!!!!!!!
Do you like to live in the centre of Alfama? No cars in the street .... but you have to climb a little.  Here is a good and clean appartment, fully equipped, a friendly host Jorge.
For me Buyincoins is the best Chinese webshop around, the products are very cheap and there are no shipping costs. Even though the quality of the products is not always the best (still better then the most of the other Chinese webshops), the products are so cheap i can't complain. All the products i ordered arrived perfecty.
Straightforward and simple ordering - well informed on the delivery progress - arrived in good time and good condition. Lovely product too!
I definitely recommended to everybody. Very good quality and trustworthy website.
When you are in trouble and you need to find something just ask google :d
i know this webshop for a long time and i appreciate the support and the cheap price of the G2PLAY CREW. Recent years I have bought many games and they still work, fast deliverers en you can see all your purchased keys on your g2play account
Quality products with branches we don't find in Belgium. Good quality and nice service. People already asked us several times where we bought our clothes and swimwear, even people we didn't know...on the beach and swim pool...
Product is great, unfortunately very unfriendly customer service rep! therefore I decided to purchase my shirts elsewhere.
Everything we ordered was in perfect order: delivery at the hotel, two pair of glasses and sunglasses. And at an amazingly low price. Even the last minute change of sunglasses gave no problems. We are most satisfied and will recommend D.S. To our friends.
I ordered flowers and chocolates, payed in total 80 euro. The flowers, no problem, on time and nice boeket (61 euro), but no chocolates. The chocolates (12 euro), we are now 1 week later, still not seen. Contacted customer service at the first day, they checked what happend, and wrote email back to me for say sorry, problem is located at the florist, he missed the added products. Chocolates will follow later and extra gift will be included. But after 1 week later, still no chocolates and no extra gift. And i still have no date when the extra product will be deliverd. The 1 star is for the flowers. Customer service don't give an solution :-( They accepted that it wass a mistake, they offer an extra gift, but that is it. They don't give me a date for when the extra's will be delivered, and they don't give me a follow up from the actions they take. I have no information about the actions they take, if they take actions, they only contact me if i write, again, first to them. Even when the chocolates will arive now, my wife and kids already said we never gonna put it in our mouth, you complained and God know what they have done with it. We have a rule, never make the person angry who prepare your food.
Pretty quick delivery and good communication. Not satisfied with the quality of the clothing. The price fits with the appearance of the clothing.. Don't think I will purchase anything again at boohoo.com
THE sunglasses, which I have been looking for for a few years... I have finally found them at the Sunglasses shop. However, when I received them (very quickly by the way!), they were not fully what I expected from them. Fortunately, they also had it in different colours and without any problem I could send the glasses back and within a few days I received the new ones, which I absolutely l-o-v-e. Even though I live in the Netherlands, it does not form any problem! Thankyouthankyouthankyou.
I ordered a couple of glasses and was happily surprised about the quality for that price. So I ordered the same model as a back up and another one with tinted glasses as sunglasses. All together it costed no more as a single pair of glasses at a regular store.
Good collection and fast delivery via DPD which is a big plus!
Ordered 2 times from the Netherlands. First time i got my order in only 4 days! 2nd time it unfortunately took a little longer (2 weeks). I contacted ChemicalUK to be sure my order was on it's way and their response was really fast. Great prices, quick delivery and good service. What else do you need? Btw i ordered clothing.
Love this website, they sell everything you are looking for. Shipping to The Netherlands is fast and easy.
Heb mijn machine pas 1 week maar tot nu toe heel tevreden. Nu zien of ie het ook op de lange duur vol houdt.
Stayed in midtown Manhattan with my wife and sun with verry good feelings. The appartment would be at the 19th floor but in stead we get an appartment at the 36th floor which was great! Never seen a vieuw quit like this before. Location perfect in midtown. The appartment was clean and had everything we needed. If i have to say one negative thing, it had no tv and the beds are a bit at the smaller size. For NY standard i would recommend to everyone!
It's good to buy and to see that  Allbeauty deliveries quickly. Package was okay. So I think it is a very good site to buy also a next time. Many thanks.
I bought a full meal plan for a month for around 140 pounds everywhere else it would of been over 250. So this is great. I`m looking forward to the results and the overall taste of these products.
I was looking specifically for this lamp and ordered it with Eden Illuminazione as it was much cheaper than in The Netherlands. If it only comes to 10 - 20 euros that's OK, however in this case I was able to save more than 100 euros!! Furthermore the shipping was only 10 euros, it was very well boxed and arrived within 4 working days. If you're looking for an extraordinary lamp of Italian design Eden has it all. The site is clear and easy to use and comes with two languages which comes in hand for me perché il mio italiano non è così buono. ;-)
I ordered a stethoscope with initials. I live in the netherlands and was happily surprised by the rapid delivery (within 2 days) including the right initials on the stethoscope.
Trip advisor should be more alert concerning false voting. In Belarus a complete restaurant mafia is flourishing because of this artificial voting
I have ordered several items for the past two years at DX.com and I am very happy with these products. The shipping time to Holland takes about 3 weeks, but that is a fact and not a problem for me. If something is not o.k. the solve our problem very good, for example : last time I ordered a Androidbox and the remote control did not work when it arrived. After contacting the customer support they send me a new one. I definitelly recommend this supplier to my friends and family!!

good service and good booking system, reliable I would say.
Great service, was able to really surprise an Irish friend from behind my desk in the Netherlands. Easy, fast and -as I heard- beautiful flowers!
the just do what they promissed, the prices are real prices no surprises afterwards and really super quick delivery from HKG to Europe within 48 hours by DHL
ik ben super tevreden over de service van telecom telecom en raad dit iedereen aan
The service and  delivery are very good, the quality of the goods are excellent.
ik ben heel tevreden over de levering van de cartridges
ik ben heel tevreden met de afhandeling van mijn order en het terugstorten van het geld
Transfered money to my skrill account, didn't show up on my account. I had to email them and I got a ticket. A few days later I got my money eventually. Now I can't make any online payments with my credit card anymore. Not worth using skrill anymore.
my order came quick. was nicely packaged. nothing damaged good quality. and i will be making another order very soon. especially for x-mas.
I've been using AltDrive since March/April 2013 and I'm particularly happy with their fast and helpful client support - in addition to the fact, that their client software is available for Linux as well. I have no previous experience as administrator with root access to a Linux machine. I bought a barebone PC and put Linux Mint on it in order to use it as a file sharing device in our household - i.e. as a NAS. It was easy to install AltDrive on he machine. A couple of times I have run into issues with AltDrive on my machine. When I contact the client support, I always receive a customised helpful response within hours and a constructive subsequent dialogue until the issue is resolved. I never receive those standard robot responses that many big companies produce and the staff is very knowledgeable about Linux systems. For 45 USD per year and unlimited storage, that is good value for money!
Bought a complete Hope brake set including pads etc. Easy to find in the online shop, nicely presented with competitive prices. Order placed on Friday and delivered on Monday, well packed, perfect!
ordered 4 pair of shoes from the online sale. Waiting for over 3 weeks now and havent recieved anything. Contacted customer service by phone and got my money back, but I would rather have the shoes i've ordered. Called dutch postal service and they told me my parcel has not been delivered to the Netherlands at all. After this contacted royal mail (the newlook customer service told me that this company would deliver my parcel) and they could not help me because new look gave me a wrong track and trace code (starting with PAP) . Really disappointed about this, but at least they gave me back my money wich i think is a good thing. anyone else from the Netherlands who HAS recieved their order after weeks of waiting? Because I still hope I will get my shoes someday.
I am always very much content with the products of Just Vitamins !!
De site is zeer overzichtelijk. De levering heel snel. De ring was precies wat we er van verwachten, heel erg mooi!
Do not buy your game here ! They sold me the titanfall Russian version with a message on their site that you could just change the language. I could not. I bought it on march 13 and they updated the site on march 13. When I wrote them a complaint about it they changed the site but did not refund my game . I even wanted to get the worldwide version from them and pay the difference but they won’t even reply my messages. They promise that when the cd key does not work you get a refund and the cd key language change does not work the way they firstly said it would ! So the cd key does not work ! Nice promises on this site just a shame they aren’t true. CJS :Warranty Information Full warranty offered. Customer satisfaction guaranteed, or your money back. it even says so on their site ! And they only show 5 star reviews on their site!
Ive been to lots of different game key websites But this one really stands out in the crowd. Delivered in mere minutes No payment issues And great helping service Ultimatum Game Keys is one to keep in mind when buying game keys.
Service perfect, shipping time perfect, price in relationship w/quality perfect. I really loved the package, the bracelet and the practical bag that came with each of my two purchases, as presents. I'll be definately buying again from this shop in the future.
i order so now and then and im always happy about my orders never had any real problems with an order. one time i had an order that took very long before it was delivered and i contacted zavvi with email and they helped me very good. mostly i buy games and sometimes some clothes  everything is well packed, and the prices are pretty cheap. also i like it that zavvi puts out alot of special deals like mega monday etc. and giving away some discount codes. all i can say is keep up this good work (Y)
de service en snelheid en de de perfecte mailing over het artikel is gewoon heel erg goed.
FloraQueen effectively delivered my flower order, not cheap but good value, mail communication after order on delivery details did not work properly but in the end all went well
I'll tell you more when I have received my item.
The company was very accommodating when we arrived late for our crossing due to traffic jams. We were allowed on the next boat without any additional charges. The ferry itself looked a bit tired and could do with some refurbishment. The staff  in the restaurant and coffee bar was very friendly and helpful .
jammer dat de track en tracing in het engels was verder prime verlopen.
Very cheap and received within promised time to the Netherlands!
Awesomebooks is for me ideal for completing my library at low prices. The free delivery to NL is absolutely great!
The order we made was send  to us very quickly and just what we were looking for!!
I recieved the parcel very quick in the Netherlands and at reasonable costs.
Just ordered some camera accessoires. Clear descriptions, photo's, good prices, low shipping charges (from China to the Netherlands) - and *fast* shipping.. the order arrived while I am still waiting for orders of _other_ China based shops, which were shipped 10 days before! Also there's this nice touch with the items - eg. they deliver not a standard lens-cap, but one with a small hole on the side (and even a rope) to keep you from losing the cap. Highly recommended.
I really love Miniinthebox/Lightinthebox!! I would recommend this site to everybody! Al my jewelry and electronic devises come from Miniinthebox/Lightinthebox and all work really well! Only the shipping is sometimes a little late, but that doesn't really bother me.
I booked and it would cost 228 Euro's and when I had to pay it appeared to be 233,75 Euro's. Explain or give me a refund for 5,75 Euro's. Ton van Gageldonk
My first order at chocolatetradingco.com for a friend in the UK. Would be ordering any time again: excellent order handling, got updates on the delivery status and my order was delivered within time.
Very quick response to my email and also fast delivery in the Netherlands, as fast as could be expected. The possibility to pay by PayPal is excellent. My order was handled perfectly and I will order again. Absolutely!!
It i a great shop for almost everything gadget stile. Cool gasoline lighters, folding knifes, shirts with moving lights on it, 10 meters led lighting, lasershows for parties, ugliest halloween masks you ever imagined. Light bulbs, light bulb converters, motor and home alarm systems, bike lights and accesories. I have it all and more, everything works great, with the reviews from others and the forums you can see if the item is fit for you... I will shop here a lot longer i think...
You have to check them out and place an order to get the great experience. I always receive my deliveries quickly and never had any hassles. Thanks!
The delivery was quick, as it only took 3 days (with a sunday in between) for my order to be delivered. I was also able to follow the package and be informed on the date of delivery (including a three-hour time frame). I would definitely order again at e-outdoor! * I live in the Netherlands
Guys from focalprice are really reliable and with very good knowledge of their products. They know exactly what the customer want which is quick and very good service/shipping and thats what Focalprice does. Keep up the good work guys. Thank you!
To place a review I registered. Unfortunately there was no way to update my profile or log out so I mailed to custum-support. They answered promptly (and in my own language) but stated that my profile was registered through Facebook. I don't even use Facebook!! I tried to explain but they had no idea what I was talking about so I got replies that got me nowhere. No more placing reviews through Trustpilot for me! PS after a few more emails this problem will be solve (i hope :))
ik was zeer blij met de info op de site en dat ik het snoer de volgende dag al kon gebruiken
Order arrived promptly and in very good condition. It had even the UK adapter with it as described might be the case in the description. The only complained would be that the packaging it came in was much bigger than the actual camera box and so it was just sliding around in the packaging, which for a delicate item like this seemed very careless. However, I'm pleased to say it did not damage the product.
Delivery took some time, but the prize was low. That compensates the time I had to wait. Type of battery was hard to find (used in a French telephone) so it is therefore worthwhile to wait some time. Anyhow, a beter communication about the expected time of delivery is requiered.
Orders always came in perfectly composed and detailed, shipping time has always been shorter than declared. Never had a complaint.
het was er heel snel en de reactie op mijn mail was ook heel snel beantwoord super
very short delivery period, all necessary feedback, will use them again
I live in the Netherlands and this site is perfect becausse i can pay with paypal and my order came in within  only a few workingdays. I didn't expect that, there was no trackingnumber shown, but it arrived quite quickly after they send the package
heel gemakkelijk op ieder moment van de dag te bestellen ideal
i ordered the shoes I already had in another color. Nice to have them in white now!
Overall I give a high-five for the quality and service of Euro-car. Tip: The location of the car hire station is hard to find. A few signs with the company name outside of the entrance of the airport would do. Or a map on the reservation form. Matter: When we picked up the car no one controlled the car for any damage, so I discovered one when we arrived at our destination. I don't know what the policy about this matter will be.
Not cheap memory I ordered, but it is best quality and works fine and was sent to me very quickly and arrived within a few days.
Everything went very went and very quickly. No comment what so ever.
I have purchased a number of items from Mr Central heating from boiler through to rad valves -  They are very competitive regarding price and quality. Would definitely use again. Staff very helpful and friendly, cant fault the service! :)

I use Trustpilot sometimes, however recently I got very disappointed. Apparently if a company does not like your review they will mark it as "Against rules of Trustpilot" or something similar. Result? Review is not being shown anymore. It seems that Trustpilot is getting money from those companies perhaps? Anyways, fix that and I will change my review about Trustpilot.com / Trustpilot.nl. However I seriously doubt this review will stay on here for very long and probably will also get marked as "Against rules of Trustpilot". Two thumbs down for Trustpilot!!
Warning!! First class scammers!! I placed an order for several products on the 17th of August (paid throuh Paypal straight away). According to their website, the item was on stock and could be shipped within a few days. In the meantime I went on vacation, but after I came back, I noticed my items were still not shipped. The status was still on "27-8-2012 0:26:39 PrepareShipment Order is being prepared for shipment." So I created a support ticket asking why it was delayed and what the current status was. Maybe they did ship it, but forget to change the status of the items. I got an answer back that they were sorry about the delay(s) and it would ship straight away. However after 3 days I still didn't receive a shipping confirmation, so I checked the online status. And to my disappointment I saw it changed to: "29-8-2012 20:37:10 BackOrder One or more of your items are temporarily out of stock." What the ....? The items were on stock when I placed the order. Secondly; in the support ticket they said it would ship out straight away?! Created a follow-up ticket and no response after a few days, then I created another ticket and finally got a response stating that I should show some more patience?! After waiting for over 3 weeks for items to ship, while they were on stock when I oredered them? As you might understand I got pretty upset about this, so I created a new ticket follow-up and since then no more replies or answers. The current status of the ordered (and paid for) items is: "5-9-2012 9:07:19 PrepareShipment Order is being prepared for shipment." It's now the 17th of September, so another 12 days have passed since the (latest) status change. This is really unacceptable. I understand it takes a few days to ship an item which was on stock when I placed the order and I also can understand it takes a little longer when an item suddenly gets out of stock (though it was shown on stock when placing the order), but 30 days waiting? This is really not acceptable!! I still haven't received anything. Items still aren't shipped. No more replies on support tickets. I am really get the feeling I got scammed by DealExtreme.com / DX.com!! And if the purchased items ever do get shipped (which I highly doubt) it will take another 2 through 3 weeks before they arrive in my country. So that means, if the items got shipped today (of course this will not happen), it will arrive in 3 weeks (worst case scenario). That would mean it would have taken almost 2 months in total! This is not acceptable. Even for a lousy and unreliable company as DealExtreme.com / DX.com. Next time I will be ordering again at Miniinthebox.com. They aren't the best, but at least they deliver promptly and do not advertise with fake stock inventories. My advice; do not do business with DealExtreme.com / DX.com. Chances are high that you will never receive your ordered (and paid for) products. So once again; avoid DealExtreme.com / DX.com at all costs if you value your money!
I will definately order again with the British corner shop. I've told all my British friends that live here in the Netherlands about you and they are very excited. My own experience is that all the products ordered were great and the service was quick! Love to order again soon because most of my favourites can be bought through your website!
Ik had verzorgd om de levering op een specifieke dag van de week te laten bezorgen en dat is ook gebeurd.
Thank you so much! It's a real pleasure to do business with you. Hope to see you again!
My wife was excited with the delivery of the GHD styler but what a disappointment! The styler was useless in the Netherlands due to a UK powerplug! Official statement of GHD Hair was: You can expect a UK plug when you buy from a UK webshop. But.... we didn't! On GHD Hair we choose for "Rest Of The World" and not UK. When we bought some kitchen equipment in a UK webshop they delivered a UK to Europe adapter free of charge and why not! The costs of the adapter is not even 2 euro.... Think again GHD!!
The Tan Alcantara Executive Case I ordered was delivered much sooner than I expected (international mail with tracking). The build and quality of the materials used is much better than I expected considering the price, Its definitely build to survive a few bumps. Not to forget it offers all the necessary protection. Face down due to front lip and off course back protection. But all in all the best thing about the case is probably that everybody loves the looks of it.
At the begin I thought is it smart to buy outside The Netherlands ? Slane is very reliable (do I spell this correct ?) so I discovered. I would recommand Slane to all my friends
Ordered a rose bouquest floral gift for a good friend.  I think I had forgottento sign my name because, it would be a week later before she would discover who it was that had sent it.  She said, 'a lovely bouquet'.
I bought from the official Queen store, excellent. good delivery
Quick delivery for me to the Netherlands. There are good reviews, The Descriptions of the products are good and if you already been a customer, you can order very quick.
FFX delivered the wrong nails with the nailer I bought (which was a good deal in itself). The right nails were delivered by next day delivery next day after I contacted Folkestone. Great!
This I dislike!!!! You start with "PLEASE" as if you were asking me a favour .................. and then I notice dat it is nót a friendly request but an order. I have to write otherwise I cannot post anything!!!
EDIT: So, they apologized and they gave me a 25% off code. I wanted to give them a second chance so I tried to use it 2 weeks later and guess what? The code didn't work. (Note: there was no sign of a date it would expire). It's all false promises and lies. OLD MESSAGE: The delivery was really late and the delivery company made a couple of mistakes. The products were so different from the pictures, some of the details weren't even visible.
We ordered a Fort Focus or simular type of car. Web site showed a brand new type Focus, but we got a Vauxhall Astra, previous model. No big deal, de car was exelent, clean and no damage.
Delivery was fast and the quality of the memory purchased excellent. A laptop which had been dead (black screen) for some time was revived and because of the upgrade from the original 512mB to 2 gB is now performing as if it is new again.
I arrived at an appartement at  Rue Chapon 42 in Paris yesterday. After my host had left I discovered that the shower has hot water only. And I mean hot! They know about this already because there in the information manual they say, that the fauced for cold water is difficult to turn "but it would be too expensive to have it repaired". As if this was not enough from 16 hours last afternoon dirty water is dripping through the bathroom ceiling - in different places. So I cannot use the bathroom. I´m using my umbrella to use the lavatory. My host does not answer his phone or return my calls. Wimdu is closed! The information manual gives an emergency number. This is a helpdesk in a far away country which cannot help me because they cannot identify me, even if I give them my booking code, my appartement number, my name and email adres. There is an emergency email-adres (!) to which I sent a message. They very kindly phoned my home number (!), where they could not reach me (no guys, I`m in Paris, remember) and said they are closed for the weekend but will try to help  me on Monday, Anyway, I should contact my host they say. By the way: This was supposed to be my holiday.
Prettig dat de voortgang van de levering met track is te volgen.
De levering was snel maar de maten verschillen per model jack and jones broeken
Ordered 3 items, but the next day i saw i got a refund on one of them. The other 2 i got within a few days! Boohoo will see me again
After some initial confusion about StVZO compliance it all worked out fine.
Booked at bravo flight because they have te best prices. After I payed for the booking I received the e-ticket within 5 minutes
Het is een erg duidelijke site en de service is perfect!!
I had a problem with the color of the cards I initially recieved. When I reported the problem Goodprint fixed the color problem and printed new cards without any costs. The cards now look wonderfull.
It was my first time order and the way they treat the new accounts is great in my opinion. Building in an extra security check really builds confidence. As soon as the security check was done my code was delivered. All in all it took less than 5 minutes.
just got the F1 key form them for a great price! got my key after one hour! amazing site guys!
Splendia's selection of hotels eliminates the less attractive choices, which makes it easier to find a decent (and often modern, contemporary) hotel. Other organisations offer endless rows of hotels and B&B's of very  varying quality. I find this very discouraging at times and it is time-consuming. Splendia gives you essential information and the pictures you need in a compact form. There's a short charactarisation of the type of hotel with each listing, the rating other guests have given it, a map, possibility of reading reviews. We've stayed in about seven Splendia Hotels so far and are very satisfied. Their Club Member benefits add to this feeling.
Based on the promising reviews here, we ordered an Eames office-chair. To our surprise it arrived earlier than expected, however when opening the box it contained only the base of the chair. We phoned and they promised to investigate the problem, which was also promptly confirmed by a reply to my additional E-mail. After some days we got a bit worried if this was going to be one of these cases we all read about on the internet. However apologies were received for not having communicated properly with us. The missing part  had been lost during transport. It would be send again and indeed, after a couple of days we were the happy owners of a fantastic chair. All in all a very good performance of this Company.
Great site great support sometimes takes a little long but for the rest great work
Some initial hobbles in the ordering process were fairly quickly overcome thanks to the intervention of a representative of the shop. Very friendly, very professional, and the order came in shortly afterwards.
I ordered a rug by Hay and everything went well, the product was delivered within the specified deadline. I did not have to send anything back so I cannot say if that works well or not. It was not easy to remove all that plastic the rug was wrapped into (less plastic would do) but I guess they wanted to make sure nothing gets damaged during transport. I would recommend this shop to others.
The product I bought (lamp) was deliverd within the agreed time, in good 'shape' and the quality matched the online picture and description.
It 's my first experience with airportrentals. So far, so good. The website is user friendly en gives you a good oversight of the available cars and rates.
I wanted to open an account a year ago but somehow it was unable to upload the required documents trough the site. To make a long story short: i never got a prepaid creditcard, never got any reply from the Skrill workers and i ended up losing €2,95 because i had to withdraw my €10 that i had made, since i never got anything! So right now i paid €2,95 for NO SERVICE! It's propably a nice product if it works great, but if you have a problem you will end up loosing your money. My advice: pay a little more, but get a better product.
I've made a typing error and the housenumber was missing. But the order was already processed. The customer service was very very helpful and although they've had to search a big distribution center, they have found my package and put the housenumber down. I've received the package the next day! Everything was well packed en products are great! Thanks for the effort! Big kiss to you all! Have a merry christmas and a wonderful 2011! M. Vogel
De site is duidelijk en de service is goed en snel.
Recently bought a blackmagic cinema camera for a unbeatable price due to an extra coupon code provided to me by mail. I had a somewhat complicated order but Tyler from GoElectronic was very very helpful. Very fast and clear mail response and good shipping. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this to anybody.
In general, a webshop which is quite ''ok'', but unfortunately the customers services are far from ''ok''. They mail within 24h, if they believe it's necessary, but it took me 6 mails (total of mails between me and them) to get an answer on my question. Next to that  are they giving wrong information about release dates and CD types (digi/jewelcase etc) and delivery dates on their site, which might be seen as misleading..
I've ordered quite a few times at BSI Merch, since Within Temptation has gone UK with their merch company. I've had almost no problems in the beginning with ordering via BSI, only a bit delay with my ordered items, but thats not a big point of negativity. A few months the trouble with BSI Merch started. I've ordered two mugs, and after 2 weeks of shipping I still didn't receive them. I mailed BSI Merch at least three times, no reply. After 3 weeks I decided to send them another email. I had to wait almost another week again, but they finally replied for the first time. I had to confirm my shipping address to them, and after a few days I received an email that everything was correct, I just needed to wait another 2-4 weeks, if the mugs were still not in by then, I had to contact them again. After more than 4 weeks of shipping, I finally received my mugs... Next problem, I've ordered a poster on BSI Merch, and after a month that poster wasn't shipped at all. After sending over 5 emails to them, I decided to send them another email. After half a week I suddenly received an e-mail back with screenshots of my orders, and that they've been shipped for quite a few days already. But these were for my OTHER items, and NOT the poster. So I mailed again.. When this other poster will be shipped - guess - no reply again. After waiting more than a month, the poster finally got shipped. Next to a terrible customers service, BSI Merch is also having ridiculous  high shipping costs. For a normal poster to The Netherlands you pay 3,50€, but for another poster (art print, also rolled in a tube - maybe a bit more weight) you pay 6,50€ MORE -with a total of 10,00€! Only for shipping! You also barely get an email confirmation when your items are shipped, very annoying, but when you get it the info in it isn't right. Since they say 2-6 days shipping to UK & EU. And no, thats not, and you could've read above. Yes, there is some positivity - thats why they get more as 1 star, but more negativity. Such a shame, since you are such a fragile company as merch store.. Everything is about you and your customers. No customers is.. No company!
Love the stylish clothes, the designs and the quick service !
Wonder wether a xxxl shirts fits well....yes it did! Now i hope more to come
The website is good at sectioning things to find what you need for a specific occasion, it shows what is in stock and what is not, which is a problem I have personally had with many other websites. It is also very quick to check out and buy, and very easy to figure out, even for me as a foreigner, and it arrived within 2 days, surprisingly quick and easy. 10/10
Great service; second time use without issues. Transfer of a few K  from the UK to the Netherlands within 12 hours received on my Dutch bank. Saved a lot compared to a regular international transfer and I guess speedier than a regular international transfer.
The code you guys sent me did not work! I will ask for reimbursement from PayPal today! Tedmooyman@gmail.com
Already a few years agoo, but I still am angry about the fact that I have lost hundreds of euro's bij using Paypal. And they did nothing! Even the local Police was involved and could not convince them that paypal was not safe. So I would warn everybody for this company NOT to use it.
If you consider buying something here: be prepared to get a good piece of equipment for a very low price. But be also prepared to throw it in the garbage the moment it stops working. Do not send a broken item back. You will have to pay for shipping and you will never see your item, or your money back. They just deny to have received the item, though track&trace says it is delivered. So buy a nice cheap phone or tablet but don't expect any support or warranty the moment it stops working.
twee shirts besteld en de volgende dag had ik ze al in huis. erg snel en goed.
Nice service, with humor, at the pickup desk. That were the right ingredients for my short trip to Holland. The car was even better than the one showen on the booking page
I have used DX a lot for years, it used to be ok but it has become a victim of its own succes. It happens a lot that they send an email after weeks that an item is not in stock after all. When this is the case you have to contact customer service yourself as the automated email does not show which item from your order is unavailable. I have asked them about this, their systems are simply not up to it. Online (chat) support is worthless, they are slow and unreliable, I have experienced staff not acting on their promisses multiple times. The most recent (and last time) the excuse was that they 'simply receive too many orders' so they were so busy that there was no time to process my order. This was two weeks after I had placed and payed for my order! I had to contact them three times just but they never sent me the goods. I cancelled my order and am done with them.
Whatever you order, it arrives generally within days and works like it should. Whan having problems, these are being solved by refund or sending a new item.
Fortatrust is cheap, and they reply supporttickets within 10 minutes! Uptime is good. Control panel needed not more than a hour to setup the server, received an email when it was active with much details.
I like WorldRemit, because it is so easy to send money to your loved ones and to your close friends. If I have to help you to choose, who is the best partner in sending money, than you have to use WorldRemit and I do not have to tell more to proof it, because I am using it frequently. Thank you WorldRemit for your trustful and fast help, to get it with my friends....
I hate the sites where you continually have to key in all your travel & passenger details & so on every time you want to change the date. This site is extremely user-friendly & you can compare the prices within seconds. Great. Will use again.
Nice price, fast and free shipping, good website,easy to order and above of all: quick and personal response on email to customer service!
I did not expect such an amazing service! I bought shoes with a lowest price on Internet, which is also great. Everything nicely packed, delivered in time, with great explanations about returning the products and you don't have to print out anything - everything is already done for you. It's definitely not the last time that I buy shoes here!
Ik ben heel tevreden over de de aankoop en de service
I have bought 2 jumpsweaters by BOOHOO and they are vice nice. not pilling afther washing en they wear very comfortable. I say buy by BOOHOO.
I ordered ( and paid ) a Nikon 135mm f/2 DC lens. Just hours after I placed my order, they raised it's price with about €500. For over a week, I heard nothing from them. Then they sent me an e-mail, claiming that the item was damaged, and that they couldn't send a replacement. Their website said they had 2 more items on stock, so I asked them to sent one of those. They quickly 'updated' their stock status to 0, and claimed that the stock status was incorrect, and that they couldn't ship the item. I asked them to cancel the order, and refund the money. They immediately updated their stock status back to 2. A lot more e-mail conversation followed. They refused to ship the item, and their e-mails were full of poor excuses and blatant lies. They never made the refund. I had to get my money back through the credit card company. This 'store' is absolutely unreliable. Never order anything from them. They'll take your money, and you'll have to hope and pray that you'll ever get anything. Spend the extra money to order with a reliable shop. Simply Electronics isn't worth it.
Record delivered in prompt time and communication was excellent regarding order status and despatch time.Would recommend to other people.
my code was wrong and couldnt ever possibly be what i wanted. AND they dont refund me and let me fix this stuff what will take a long time before i get my money back.
Thinking I would be scammed by smaller and cheaper rental companies I was completely disillusioned by my Hertz experience. First of all, the rental agent in Italy tried to have us take as many extra services, claiming some as legally obligated when they were not. He also charged us for them when he confirmed verbally that they were for free. Now they keep billing me for the same thing over and over again, while it has been paid for months ago. My e-mail about this issue was answered A MONTH after I sent it. Save yourself the cost, rent a car with the cheapest alternative. Truth is, every car rental company will scam you eventually. Might as well get scammed by the cheapest one.
The buyer protection program is absolutely great if you're an honest person who wants to secure himself from being scammed. However, if you're selling, any dishonest person can claim back his or her money, which blocks all your funds. I had both experiences already and while the buyer protection program did save me a few bucks, I lost those again due to malevolent buyers.
I ordered football shirts from this website even though I had a bad feeling beforehand. However, I set my prejudice aside and ordered from a chinese website. Biggest, mistake, ever. After four weeks, which is a lot more than the 11-day shipment time, I finally cut the rope and reclaimed my money through paypal. Afterwards I found many bad reviews about this scam of a company. DO NOT let them fool you saying it's a US based company. They are Hong-Kong based and ship via guangzhou
But discount and points not always reliable. I have made 2 a ordre with points and there was a emails discussion, without a solution of golf support. I have to order 2x a new product with shipping cost of €10. Also i have a email for the price of 288 callaway golfballs without answer. I order them eleswhere. The size of the gloves where not good, i send them back, it cost me more then the one i order !!!
One of the bottles was already broken before I openened it up. I was able to smell it through the package. The nailpolish spilled all of the other nailpolishes and glass is all over the other bottles. The labels and the bottles are ruined and everything is sticky and dangerous because of the glass from the broken bottle. I also cut myself with the broken glass while I was opening the package. I was trying to remove the bottles but they were sticking to each other with the polish and the glass. Some other bottles have damaged glass also. I tried to clean the bottles with aceton but it's not working. I send a mail twice to the sales department but no reply.
This is the 3th time I ordered something. I received my order within a couple of days. Super!!!
Although they offer you the possibility to pay your order with an non-UK bank card they tell you later they will cancel the order because they don't accept the bank card. A few days later they refund the money but not the full amount. So I lost 5 pounds for nothing.
My case looks wonderful and it's not that you can see the pixels. Perfect quality and the service from EGOsketch is amazing!
Ordered here multiple times the last two years and their service is perfect! Delivery of keys is quick and if you do need to contact them a response is quick and friendly. When they are getting rid of the DVD boxes they also offer combined shipping which keeps the cost down :)
I do not fully trust the gold and silver practices in general, but after a thorough investigation I found BullionVault offers an extremely safe way to buy, store and sell these metals. Through daily audits, where pseudonyms may be used, you can be sure that the metal you purchase is actually there. Also, you can buy and store precious metals in different countries, allowing you to diversify the risk of governmental control / confiscation. Moreover, should your account be hacked, then no metal or currency can be redeemed to someone other than you, AND you will receive a log in notice by e-mail, so you will know if and when someone else accessed your account. They can, however, buy and sell your gold to possibly themselves (via another account) - Though I'm sure BullionVault will do it's best to undo the damage, especially if you act fast. Apart from these issues, its website is quite consumer-friendly, the charts are clear and the fees are very reasonable. I am a very happy consumer, and I recommend this company to everyone interested in owning gold or silver.
ik vindt het een lekker matras,misschien iets te hard maar het went
I used the Dutch version of the website, which differs a lot from the English one. My suggestion is that if you want to book a ticket for a ferry in advance, just do it at the local harbour. The Dutch website is a disaster. You can't compare prices, even if there are multiple companies. You can't change your voucher, it will cost you at least 70 euro's. And aferry charges you 40 euro's administrative costs for amending a ticket. So if you want to change something, you have to buy new tickets. They wont give you a refund. You can reach aferry by telephone or email, and they'll promise they'll help you. But in my case, they never did. Horrible. A simple transfer from Piombino to PortoFerrario ended up costing me 300 euro's.
al na 2 dagen had ik de bestelde goederen in de bus.
Ordered here a steam key as it was cheaper then anywhere else. Within 2 minutes i had my key and activated it on steam. Use the great service of this seller ! Thanks and hope to see you soon again ! :D
We have been using them for a few years now in various countries and their service is alweays up to par with new cars in good condition and little fuss.
Absolutely great value for money. The same glasses were in the store in NL €450 and here I paid €177.
My husband and I order a photobook every year for our daughter. We are always very impressed with Photobox. and this year was no exception. Great price, quick delivery and excellent photo quality. Photobox, thank you, we'll be ordering another 100-page book this time next year :-)
i have found a shop on the internet the sale dresses  and shoes you have to see it its called  boohoo its fantastic when you see it you want to buy it and its at home in a few days its  perfect.
When ordering supplies always quick and correct completion of order
Great reliable company which supplies good service and superb quality in short time.
they delivered very quickly to the Netherlands; I hope in the future they will have more to choose from in the rabbit food.
European website which imports from china, and has many kind of payments to choose from. shipping is free ( yes free shipping from china ) ,  I have ordered 3 times,  the shipping time is about 2 - 2.5 weeks ( to netherlands ) . It comes in nice envelopes with bubbles with all Chinese language on it :)). Only disadvantage is the website, Most times its very slow and search is not that good, sort by works kinda odd,  some products have no images or no description. but overall good shopping experience.
Haven't been working too long with Hotels Combined but the support and software is unmatched. Easy to integrate or build a rebranded site, no tech knowledge needed. If you do have a question the people at HC help fast and provide the right answers to go on. Have been trying some programs and hotel comparing sites but they all lack in usability, HC is perfect in that way and makes it easy for everyone to make an extra earning also. When you're not becoming an affiliate but just want the best prices you're at the right address. By comparing 100+ sites you always have discounts up to 80%. Checked it out  with hotels I usually go to and I could save a lot. Only thing that is too bad is that I didn't use HotelsCombined sooner.
Very fast delivery .. good service Nice prices Keep on with it
experience the site and get so exited as i am
Sometimes when you order China to be delivered you're afraid to open the package. You shake it a little, do I hear broken cups? Not here, the shipping department wraps it very well, and it is shipped by an organization that doesn't play volleyball with the packages. Christmas came early for me!
I ordered from the Netherlands and received my order with in 4 days: i was surprised, because usually it takes a lot longer to deliver from UK, so i think this is an excellent company to order my clothing!
Als een product perfect is en de levering etc is ook perfect, dan valt er weinig over te zeggen!
I travelled from Saigon to Mui Ne by bus. This took over 7,5 hours and therefore I decided I would try out the Saigon2MuiNe service. Although it was nice to experience the bustrip next time I go to Mui Ne I will definitely take the car option both ways. The driver was perfectly on time at my hotel (even a little bit early). I was alone and had expected a car, but I was picked up by a small bus. Apparently there were more people on the way back. This meant that I had a lot of space for myself, although a car might have been a little bit more comfortable. The driver spoke enough english for some small conversations and took me back to Saigon in a little over 4 hours. We stopped halfway for a bathroombreak and a bite to eat. That was enough stopping time for me, but the driver made it clear that any time I wanted a break I just should tell him. All in all a very good experience.
This is a high quality costume, consisting of many pieces. The fabric feels soft and nice, not the cheap stuff you normally would expect. Sizing is good, not too small. The costume had a very decent packaging and arrived within 1 week in the Netherlands. I am very satisfied with the quality of the costume and great service. Would definitely buy again.
User-friendly interface of the website (the ordering process is easy and fast); variety of products, quick delivery, very reasonable prices, flexible paying - all this makes me choose Wijnvoordeel as place for buying wines. The only wish is to widen the list of wine prodiucing countries (i.e. would gladly buy Hungarian Tokaji from Wijnvoordeel)
Never had any problems after booking a hotel at this website. Prices of the hotels are reasonable. The reviews of the hotels on the website are very useful. We don't get spam from the website, just one request to fill out a short review.
very quick delivery, very good price, very beautiful tree, we are very satisfied with product. Thanks a lot
Its cheap, so dont expect a yacuzzi in your plane. But if you dont really care about comfort and just want to travel cheap then this is a great company!
I have travelled a lot and the only place where people have no facebook account is in brazil. So its great to keep in touch with people around the world.ll
No bad experiences at all. I think thats the best it can get!
I ordered a pair of Rx Adidas glasses halfway Octobre. Communicating with them was slow and difficult in such way that it often took a long while to get a response. Other times response was almost instantly. So difficult to know what to expect. After deciding I´d go for an order it took up until today (30/11/10) for me to get my glasses..... (delivered in the Netherlands from the UK). A miscommunication or something like that is supposed to have caused the delay. All in all my glasses are great, appear to be the real deal, and approx 500 euros cheaper than my high street retailer, so was worth the wait. I wouldn'have minded waiting this long, as long as I had know it before hand. Now it almost seemed as a scam, but luckily turned out to be an OK deal. I'll order here again in future, but will keep in mind it might take a bit extra time :)
During a year in Seoul I fell in love with Asian style clothes and took a ton back with me. But after a while one wants something new. Good thing I found this site, and seeing that my friends had successfully ordered here, I did the same. I got very greedy ;) But luckily they delivered: decent quality & prices, fabulous shipping. I got this ball shaped package and it took me ages to get everything out but the result was that the clothes were preserved during the long journey! :) So I can honestly say that Yesstyle is trustworthy and that they deliver what they promise. Watch out for certain sites, always look up reviews before you buy something from a site, but if you want to save the search: Yesstyle is, in my experience, trustworthy. Low prices+good quality+safe shipping = awesome wardrobe ;)
I wasn't sure in trying to buy my xbox live codes online with a new website but seeing I wanted to use PayPal and this was the first one I found I thought ah heck why not Seeing I was a first time buyer they wanted to verify my our chase after I had already paid which made me freak out a lil But I went through the easy steps and could view my code straight away!
De service is snel, de website is duidelijk. De prijs/kwaliteit verhouding van het product is ook goed.
I got great service again from Mazumo, done it in the UK where it was greeat, same here. Kept me in the loop on the progress, quick service and payment received. I used the wrong model number to claim so I go t even more money since the actual phone model was more worth!!!!!
JD Sports sells the best items you can wish. As an international customer, JD always does a lot of items we cannot buy in The Netherlands! The ship on time and alway keep me posted. That's what I like!!
jammer dat de naam scheef stond op de tas en dat hij zo klein is
The do as they say, the delivery was fast en the product was as they said there. cant complain
We ordered two books en both were wonderful. We are great fans of Abelli and even went to one of their meeting days. Great value for reasonable money.
my opinion says enough no fuss and you get wat your paying for
The items were well packaged, arrived on time, and they also sent a 5 euro voucher off my next purchase as well as a tester of foundation to try out. I would definitely shop here again.
Really nice to be able to buy UK products at reasonable prices. They are usually out of stock on a few items but the rest comes quickly and well packaged.
The package arrived but it stank so badly of cigarette smoke, and so did the dress inside. So did the driver, so I know he was smoking in the vehicle. Hardly fair to contaminate everyone's packages though. How very unprofessional and disgusting.
The item came quite fast and the quality was very good. I would order from them online again.
I recommend you to buy gems from here and not from the game it self. Here it's cheap, you can use paypal too and it only takes 5 minutes or less to receive the code and redeem it.
I'd prefer to be addressed in English like the website. But it only works partially. There is some english and french so sometimes difficult for me to understand. Like this page also. To me it's not easy to communicate in French. Apart from that I was dissapointed that my stuff arrived not in 5 workdays as expected because there was a little delay in the subscription to the website. When I saw nothing changing on the order for a few days I send an e-mail and got a reply that this person would be back at 12 november. Not really helpful... And I had a studio booking, I needed the stuff. In the end it came a day too late. So I'm not satisfied.
Booked through Eurobookings several times for reservations both in and outside Europe. After reservation, I received a prompt confirmation in my email. The search and booking-process was very clear. I like the spacious design, not as cluttered as other travel websites are.
I've been using this for 2 years now and HMA always works. It's great to surf anonymous but also works really great to logon to Steam in case your sitting in an hotel or logged on to some other evil firewall WIFI hotspots tend to run. It also works to view webcontent (video/audio)  restricted to countries your not in.
The T-shirts I ordered where a tad on the small size. I sent them back and received new ones without any fuss within one week. Everything went smooth. Thanks once again.
My overall experiences wirh boohoo are amazing! I live in the netherlands,  and even webshops in holland dont deliver as fast as boohoo. Everytime I order something, it arrives in a few days and its always correct, the right products, right colour, right sizes. The products themselfs are also of good quality, and fits perfectly like i wanted/imagined. I will defenitly order more at boohoo! Xoxo Femke
Alles in orde de sushi vers en was erg lekker!
het artikel ziet er net zo uit in het echt als op de site
ik ben heel erg tevreden met wat ik tot nu toe heb besteld en ontvangen.
My daughter and me did the tour in January and we had a very nice time, good view and enough room at the top floor. Nice that there was a speaker who told many stories about present and past events. We would recommand this tour to friends who will visit London and we will take the tour again also.
The webshop is awesome, but i had a case where one item was not in stock. They offered to sent it into two shipments and in stead of free shipment cost I had to pay for both ( which I refused to do)
Excellent service and better selection than I could find anywhere else.  I *couldn't* find what I needed anywhere else. One shop told me it would take several weeks to get these strings!
Have contacted them several times to change an item BBB  recommended but was not compatible with my labtop. In the end they told me to contact the productcompany to try and change it and never heard from them again. No service!
Was finished with the whole order and got thrown out by the system, that there are issues with delivery. After email corespondence , then only hear that some of the order can''t be sent due to weiht restrictions etc. That is poor service: don't offer the goods if you can't send them. I drastically reduced my order because of it.
I have used McAfee I.S for 7 years but since McAfee"s worldwide big screw up several months ago ( wrong DAT file send to computer with auto-update ) and their no responce what so ever attitude i've switched to ESET Smart Security. This program is faster and my computer is way faster then with McAfee install !!!!! I still have a McAfee licentie ( paid for 8 months ) but i'm never gonna use McAfee ever again. Thanks to the ( Paid per minute ) Mcafee helpdesk in the Netherlands !!
I am in LOVE with this webshop! I was a bit apprehensive at first; ordering clothes from a foreign webshop is a bit of a risk, BUT I'm happy I did! The sizes are perfectly fine so order what usually fits you. The quality of the clothing absolutely surprised me! I was expecting low-quality cotton dresses for those prices but it turned out to be strong and beautiful material (though, haven't worn it often yet so you never know about the quality). The delivery was quick and without any problems. Only downside: can't pay with iDeal, just creditcard. Will definitely order more anytime soon!!!
Ik had de keuze om en per mail en per SMS de opwaardeercode te onrvangen.
When I placed my order they informed me that the Barcelona chair was in stock and would be sent the next day. When the delivery didn't arrive I asked when I could expect it. They didn't know. I have had to call/mail three times before they told me the chair was out of stock. I received the chair 2 weeks later. I was disappointed with the customer service however the quality of the chair was excellent!
I received my order in 2 days in the Netherlands so really nice job !!!
Recently I bought a Canon lens for a good price. Quickly I received the package via DHL. Perfectly packed and very satisfying contact by mail with Customer Service in all the proces. I would recommend this company to other buyers.... Ad de Jong The Netherlands
Not just Health Monthly offer good prices and lots of product choice, but also deliver with a reasonable shipping fee in all Europe. I recommend it.
order arrived very quickly and well packaged. I will buy again.
jammer dat het met post nl niet gratis verzenden is van bv€75 of zo
De website mag nog wel wat gebruiksvriendelijker. De service is top.
Golf online was recommended to me about six years ago and since then I bought all my golfequipment by this shop.
Ordered some batteries for my walkie talkies and for some cordless phones. Living in The Netherlands I expected the order to last weeks, but within a week I had my batteries in the mail (normal mail!). Excellent service!
ik vond dat er veel keus was en dat er een hele snelle levering was
If want to buy anything for your golfgame you must visit the site of GolfOnline. Great offers.
Ordered 2 items in wrong size. Shipped them back and had my refund 2 days later. Awesome.
My wife would like to have shoes in the dark colour. From the Netherlands we googled up to here, to find these shoes. Now she is pretty satisfied. The shipping was fast and it was a best price, so all very nice.
I ordered a game before its release for about half the original price, it was delivered on the day of release without any problems. I can't give my opinion about the support as i didn't need it. Great job guys!
My experience with easybus was good, but on arrival there was a big downside. I had a flight delay of 2h due to the extreme weather in London. I bought an easybus ticket for half an hour after my planned arrival, which of course meant I exceeded the hour maximum of travelling with that ticket, so I had to buy a new ticket. The thing is, now I decided not to reserve tickets anymore, because clearly I wouldn't want to pay twice again. A little more flexibility would have been nice, especially because it was due to weather conditions in the place of arrival.
Since my last review I ordered once again via easyprint.be Once again I can confirm my item (a T-shirt at this time) arrived in time and was exactly as one would expect! The size of my T-shirt is bigger than expected though.
love both the product and the very fast delivery! I am quite impressed.
Should you ever consider ordering sweets for yourself, your relatives and/or friends, do order them at Aquarterof.co.uk  !!! So much to choose from, but even better: the friendly, kind and very efficient service. There was a slight problem with my delivery and I cannot remember when I have been helped so friendly and so well! In spite of the minor problems (NOT with Aquarterof but with Fedex, mind you!), the parcel was still delivered within a week. So as far as I am concerned: 10 out of 10 !!!! I wish this company many more happy customers!!!!
I ordered a Ducky DK9008 Shine mechanical keyboard. Website showed that 4 items were still in stock. Received a confirmation of my order saying it would be shipped in estimately 1-2 days and should arrive in the Netherlands after 2-7 days. After a few days i got impatient so sent a mail. This was not answered within 24 hours. After 2,5 days i received a polite e-mail with pretty much no extra information. After a week of waiting I assumed it would probably take ages to ship my item, so i cancelled my order through PayPal. I received a refund within a few hours which was exceptionally fast and against all expectations. Bottom line: They do not seem like scammers, but are a very unreliable company with bad communication. Then again the prices are exceptionally low.
My story is identical to that of most complainers: -purchased coffee table and a lamp on  21/12/2012 (yes: 2012). -after a couple of weeks, you realize that this is going to take some time. (something you cannot find on the website). But you think: let's give the store a chance and wait. -Then comes the standard explanation : your products have been produced, but the quality is too low, so we are going for another production round. Again: a few months extra.. -you start reading the general terms and yes : they can deliver up to 34 weeks (8,5 MONTHS) after your order. -And then in week 33, your delivery comes. And it is only the coffee table, and it's broken. (broken leg). How unfortunate. So, refund it is. -on 19/08 Infurn confirms that the full amount will be reimbursed.. But hold on : terms & conditions say > after 30 days! -So we wait until 27/09 (30 working days). Guess what happened : zip/ zilch / zero. And now they go quiet... Conclusion: The delivery time (the actual one) is not mentioned on the site. You need to read terms & conditions to see what you are actually can expect. And then they break the terms & conditions. They just don't pay back. Customer service: standard replies, mainly by phone, because they don't like things in writing. There is no real service, no real help. And Infurn makes the call after you post the review on Trustpilot. Thank you trustpilot. I will get the refund this week. I'll keep you posted in this review. HOWEVER : when they write : "Although you asked to cancel 19th August, it was on 19th September that you sent the Bank details for the refund to be processed. We have a refund guideline policy, also shown in the Terms and conditions, but after our discussion today , we have agreed upon a way forward which will be put in writing today." This is not correct: I've asked to cancel before the 19/08. Infurn confirmed, stating they would not need banking details and they would do the refund through the credit card. 3 weeks later, I've sent the bank details, just to be sure they would not mess up again. So : I've asked for a refund through credit card on 19/08. Now we are 07/10. still nothing. That is the situation. 7/10 > I received the refund. Thank you Infurn. So probably the intent is good. But execution is so poor that a lot of people (who want to spend money) just get frustrated. My suggestion : change your operations and change your name. Or be honest : put in big letters on your website: Delivery can take up to 34 weeks.
Slow, unfriendly, rude, not at all moitivated or interested in providing any decent customer service, once theyve got your money they dont care about your order. Oh yes did i for get to mention stupid!
Ordered 2 pairs of my joy shoes and kept really up to date about delivery. In fact they came 2 weeks early in perfect condition! Also the support desk was very helpfull when I called them with a question.
When we asked for an opinion what to do we got a good recommended answer. I can come very quick afther that and I'am very glad I did this, look without glasses, no pain nothing but a clear view. I recommend it to anyone. I had the Lasek method and it was very quick and good, friendly people, good answers, afther this also a good and quick consults. The price is also very good. I'am a very glad man.
Although I did not know them before I just took the gamble and ordered a LX7 at a very competitive price. To be honoust I did not know what to expect. However, I got a tracking number..ordered the camera on a Saturday evening, it arrived Tuesday afternoon. Camera even was PAL (in stead of NTSC) so no complaints at all. Highly recommended so to speak!
Delivery was free over €35,-, which is a great thing, although I wished it would be free shipping with orders from €25,-. I would order sooner again. Delivery was very fast. Unfortuantley when I had a complaint I didn't get an answer for about a week, on the BooHoo facebook I got an instant reply lucky, problem solved.
The sandals that I wanted to have are a European brand but I couldn't find them anywhere here (in Europe), at least not in the colour that I wanted - but OMCgear had them! My order was shipped out the same day, and arrived here in 12 days, not bad! The international shipping costs were high, but worth it! I'm so happy that I have these shoes now, so OMCgear: thanks!
I would like every deal to be like this. Good product for a perfect price, fast shipping and good communications. Highly recommended.
For a friend of mine who is going to move to the UK I was researching deals for her new iPhone 4S. I liked the simplicity of the site showing all deals for all major networks and the filters made me find a good deal for her. I also used other comparison sites, but the sliders didn't work on my iPad. Drawback was that I couldn't find cashback in the listings.
Dpreview always has the latest news and everything I need to know about the latest technology in photography. I sometimes join the contest and I have won 1 time. When a new camera is announced they will post a quick review on the same day. Apart from canonrumours.com (dpreview doesn't do rumours) and photographers site my only source for photography.
After reading some poor reviews, I was a bit in doubt about ordering here. However, I found that most poor reviews had to do with the postal service in the countries of delivery and not with Beautybay itself. So I decided to take a change and order anyway because I needed some hairproducts I cannot find in Malaysia. Ordering was easy, the price was good and within the same day I got word that my order had shipped. It arrived in a little over two weeks, which is quite normal for Malaysian mail (it takes 2 to 4 weeks for delivery over here). So I was very happy and will definitely order again when I need products that are not available here. The fact that even overseas delivery is free is just so great! Thanks Beautybay.
It was my first time buying anything online for delivery in europe. I am extremely satisfied with this service and especially with the quality of the flowers. My girlfriend immediately fell in love with flowers and her face just glowed with surpirse and awe. You guys made me look good! Thank you! I will definitaley be using euroflorist.nl  for my future purchases.
For a bit a individuality I decided to buy myself an diabloskin for my iPhone and I have no regrets.
gratis tas top kwaliteit en gratis bij de dry nites actie
You should really try this company.it has done wonders to put a sparkle back in my marriage of twenty years.top quality with rock bottom prices.well sone BONDARA
I wanted to buy a new camera and when I found out that with e-globalcentral I could buy this camera much cheaper then in my own country (the Netherlands) I decided to give it a go and ordered with e-globalcentral. I think I ordered the Olympus XZ-2 on a thursday and it was delivered from Hong Kong the next tuesday. The tracking option I received worked very nice so i could see where and how the package was handled.  The goods were packed very good in bubblewrap plastic and the camera is working to full expectation and makes beautifull, sharp images. I am very pleased and recommend this site to all my friends.
Having an account is a good idea on hostelworld.com. When booking you get suggestions for your next stay in the same country. I also selected a fixed price for booking so i did not have to pay reservation costs per booking. The site can be improved when booking multiple locations. Please include an option to plot your stay in multiple locations for one trip; to make the booking and selection process easier. I stayed in 7 locations in 3 weeks in Japan and wanted to select hostels that are above 80% on their overall score and available for dormatories. Having a 'plot' function where you select the nights you want to stay in one city for every location on your trip, would be an awesome addition. Maybe a timeline where you can then select places per lcoation and have click on an image of that city/location on that timeline to get you to your overview over hostels for that location.
I ordering shirts for 3 years now and i am very happy how the service is. Very personal and if something changes along the way they let u know emediatly and compensate where they can. And its nice they think along with shirt designs.
i order and the delivery was good and very fast thanks
Mijn bestelling werd heel vlot geleverd en ik ben heel tevreden over de kwaliteit van het product ( 3rd Rock From the Sun complete DVD box )
MyMemory had a great offer that I couldn't resist. I ordered and a couple of days later I received my order through the mail. Great price, great service!
The best price for my aparthotel in dubai, that's why i booked here, the netherlands an belgium page was more expensive
Excellent, easy website, up to date information of the order/delivery. Product delivered however is another brand then ordered (Bosch vs BERU).
I booked an hotel on this site, much cheaper then on booking.com or Agoda.com. Something went wrong with my payment. An employee of onhotels.com called me immediately and helped me futher with my booking. When we arrived at the location, everything was really good organised, the hotel knew we were coming, they knew our names. So it is worth booking with onhotels.com.
Got the product very quickly and it is exactly what I want. Great Service. Great shipping information
will ever be a time when google will no longer have almost all the market share ?
Avoid a this website it is not worth it, i had an order a week late
There is enough choice in clothing and the short videos of the items being modelled are also helpful in choosing a garment. Overseas shipping was also very quick.
The quality is poor, on the pictures it looks amazing, but when you receive your order some things are really ugly and not a good quality. The delivery times are something to be shamed about. And your order is not delivered at once, ok that can happen, but i sometimes get 3 deliveries from one order!
So happy with this fantastic onesie and just on time for my birthday!!
This is a great store. Nice stuff and inexpensive. The sweaters i ordered where here in no time and shipping is free!
Evaq8 is one of the best firms I've ever worked with over the internet. They delivered me the right goods on time and they have an excellent service after sales. When the Isatphone was giving some problems, I've contacted evaq8 and they respond very fast. After I've sent the phone back, they kept me updated and at the end, when the manufacturer didn't fix the problem, they've sent me another phone. So I have to say.. best service ever!
I orderded a Kindle paperwhite on Tuesday evening. It arrived on Saturday morning while there where 2 holidays in between.
I was looking for an energy-friendly domestic circulator pump and found my way to Anchor Pumps! Such an enormous offer of products and at very competitive prices!
We received the car in 5 minutes at the airport. Very fast. We received a turbo version of the car we ordered so we were very happy. The price of de rental car is also very good. Everything , all insurances, were included.
They don't deliver on the right day and the flowers are after 2 days dead.
. . . . . . . . . . .
Not good. I had to pay with my Visa card for a single ticket, whereas I could pay with Paypal for a return. This cost me unnecessary too much ;-(
Ordered few things at Telecomtelecom.nl and it was shipped to me quickly after I ordered it. Also came to me in good condition, good packed. Don't know anything about aftersales, but it looks good to me at the moment.
A really fast and accurate delivery, the parcel was well packaged. Although this is from the UK, I was surprised how quickly this happens. If I want to order for the right price, some camping gear stuff will certainly be here again.
De website is gebruiksvriendelijk. De levering gebeurt in een minimum van tijd.
I ordered a set of Nike Shoes on the 2nd of April. I live in the Netherlands, they charged me 7.50 Euros for international delivery. After 10 days no delivery I inquired what the status was and if there was a tracking number for the delivery. Then they told me they don't use a tracking number (since it is the cheapest delivery option). Now it is the 19th of April and still no sign of the delivery. I have send numerous emails to ask about the order and get a standard reply that it is due to arrive within four days. Only untill I have started to complain at Twitter they have started to reply. Now they send some kind of legal document (which takes another 10 days to arrive), where I can file the non delivery. Wow, I have never got this kind of service.
Ordered a steam key for XCOM and got it within a few minutes. I normally order my keys at Steam or G2Play but would def buy from Code4game again. Great seller!
I really have no complaints about my purchase. Everything went smoothly, there's lots of payment options and the game I bought arrived immediately. Only afterwards did a friend tell me that some websites like this one use stolen credit cards to buy games, which is why they're so much cheaper. I don't know if that's true for this site or not. And to be honest, since there's no way of knowing, it probably won't stop me from buying here again.
I ordered 10 clear nfc tags and 10 white ones. They were delivered with mail post (10 business days to Belgium). Clear information on their website and also good prices!
I found some reviews of Simply Electronics after I placed my order. I am happy they proved the bad reviews wrong. Within two weeks I received my Nexus 10. It was packed nicely and even contained two adapters that aren't part of the usual package.
Boohoo.com has some very lovely clothes! I made an order a few weeks ago, and was suprised by the fast and free delivery. The only negative point is the quality of the clothes, it's 'ok' but could be better. But because of the price, I can't really make a big deal about that. I would recommend Boohoo.com to others.
Zo netjes en duidelijk de web site is zo is de afhandeling ook, in een woord super
I'm very glad to have my boots for my ice skates. The price at SnowInn was 80 Euro lower than a normal shop in my country. The product was out of stock, so I had to wait for about 1,5 week until it was in stock. After they sent it from Spain, I received them within 6 days! I'm coming back surely!
Great booking site. A lot of hotels in their portfolio. One disadvantage: cancellation policy is pretty costly
i am very pleased with Andalusienshop, the offer great products that are hard to find. the ship fast and you can pay in many ways i am happy that i have found them ! kind regards mara
This is one of my best online shops! Keep on going guys and thanks for the 10% discount voucher!
I have no issues with British Corner shop they provide a good service, I only wish that their delivery service could deliver after five when I'm home.
I always get a good service here. They are quick in answering questions, and have a quick delivery. I always get my products in 7 days, I live in The Netherlands.
The booking of a car is simple and everything went easy when I picked up the car. Forgot to do it via the self counter but waiting time was short at Alamo. Second time I took a car from Alamo at LA and service was easy and good.
The clothings are nice condition and the service is bad, but compare with those prices in Japan its very cheap. If you like asian fashion for a good price this is the right address. People who want good service and fast shipping should stay away from VIVI Clothes. Well these are my 2 cents.
If You're smart you order here, even from Holland; it saves a lot of money and you get nice gifts. They sell all the great brands like Sebastian and Redken as well!
I got a voucher for a free photo book when I bought something from Bart Smit and I saved it to try one day and it was well worth keeping! it was so easy to do and really fun, my 8 year old even likes to add his touches and ideas! :) Delivery was very quick and the quality is great! Thank you!
Hi dear, I bought some stuff on this site, and i enjoyed them very much. They make and international delivery in an express shipping time! They were the cheapest worldwide online shop for the cartridge i bought !! I recommanded Bax-nl to you !! A+++++++++
12game.com is a good place to buy your games. The games are sent with plastic around the game, perfect condition, well packed and fast delivered. They did forget to send one of the two games I bought, but after an email from me, they sent the second game right away and apologized for the wait. So... They handled the problem quickly.
Awesome! The lunch box looks great! Mymepal offers a lot of ways to personalize your items. The quality is great, the delivery was really fast. Just perfect to create personal gifts for your loved ones or colleagues. I will definitely buy again from Mymepal. :)
Wat ik had besteld was heel snel in huis en zag er heel verzorgd en elegant uit.
I think it is a great shop. Also they are very fast with there delivery's!! The price of the clothing is very appealing in combination with the quality of the clothes!
This is a very useful way to get fast your psn money in your wallet!
The prices are the lowest around, plus with the free shipping it's even cheaper. I had a problem with a book that never arrived, they refunded me right away and delivered them properly when I re-ordered. I will definitely order again!
Boohoo has really good prices, especially for the more basic items that I bought. The shipping was very fast, it arrived just in time for my holiday!
I like the MyJoys very much and the delivery was fast too
I bought a CD Key at CJS CD Keys and in seconds I received my key after the payment.
Pre_order, op de dag van release had ik hem binnen. Wat wil men nog meer?
When all hotels are booked or when you're looking for an excellent alternative, try Wimdu. Select the accomodation of your choice, check availability and read what others have said about it. When you're satisfied, it's time for action! Booking is easy and getting in touch with your host is a breeze. Avoid last minute hassle and let Wimdu help you find that perfect place for your next trip!
When I first noticed this company and their prices I could not believe it was true. But the comments of the other reviewer I can only confirm. - compatitive prices. - quick answers on all emails - no track and trace message - delivery within 6 working days. - package was sent from the UK (hence the delay) I ordered an Fujifilm X20 and I got in the box an powerconverter for the UK and outside the box another from the UK to Euro plug. (Inside the box was also a direct euro-plug) All arrived in perfect order in bubble-wrapped package. Happy with it. No hesitation to order again from them.
Found Golfsupport while searching for a good golf bag. They've got a big selection of products and sizes. Only problem I had with the website was that they indicated there was sufficient stock, but after ordering it said it was being ordered with the manufacturer (SunMountain). So I got my golf bag a bit later than expected, but info about delivery was good though. I would use Golfsupport again, due to their competitive prices and selection.
In daylight there is a good program, friendly staff and a good balance of driving, stopping and waiting for a next bus. Buying your tickets in advance is cheaper and convenient. The commentary on the bus via headphones is ok and useful. We think we were a bit mistaken by the night tour, because the entire route as drawn on the map was not followed.
I knew I was wrong to not get the PS4 for pre-order . Everywhere in the Netherlands , was the mega bundle sold. Had little hope to still be able to get this year. After visiting many forums someone said you should try simplygames.com . Have then looked at how reliable the website was , looked good and professional. Had several times contact with the people who had bought a product. Here That was the breakthrough for the product ( ie the PS4 mega bundle) to buy . However, in terms of price , I know that they benefit because they are one of the few who had the product in stock then. I thought to myself as I keep extra wait, I'll get it until early next year . If I wanted him out of the Netherlands. So that the extra € 100 , - where they benefit no longer interested me and bought the product on 17-12-2013 . I received the product the 19-12-2013 at home . I am so pleased with the store , but if you do so you feel screwed by simplygames.com to € 100 , - extra demands , then you just do not buy easy choice , right?
iCarhireinsurance.com is the perfect and very easy solution for the often (very) expensive Loss Damage Waiver rates, charged by car rental companies. Just go to their website iCarhireinsurance.com and easy does it. I really wish I had found out about this years ago. It would have saved me a lot of money.
The packaging was discreet and very quick delivery for a great price!
Previously, I wrote stating I received an empty box with no product. After writing a complaint to customer service, I have received my missing product promptly. I am absolutely satisfied with CondoomFabriek for their quick response and delivery. Thank you CondoomFabriek, I now have trust in your business and I will advise others to order from CondoomFabriek in the near future.
ik vond het een makkelijk programma om mee te werken en door de snelle levering erg tevreden.
I found Agoda website to be very useful and easy to use. It's easy and clear to navigate and compare hotels. Prices are real time, and many good offers. It's safe an secure as well. Moreover, we can collect points to be redeemed later. Excellent website and very recommended!
I bought an ink cartridge (private label or their own brand) for an excellent price, with free delivery cost! it got delivered just the day after, perfect!
I bought many PS3 games from them with always good prices and fast delivery. I returned an item and got refund. All thanks to good and constant communication with the customer service. Very recommended!
I bought Crysis 2 Limited Edition yesterday. Today it got delivered. Good price, almost the same price with Crysis 2 standard edition. Fast service. But the game case is a bit cracked although it is still partially sealed with the plastic cover. I guess the case got pressed too hard from above, so it got a bit broken. It's okay with me though because the contents are still intact.
My order got delivered the day after! super fast and the website is easy to use. Recommended.
Although I have to wait for about 4-5weeks before I got the item (item was out of stock), the service was helpful and polite. The sunglasses is original and authentic. I bought a RayBan and I can easily recognized that it is authentic. I would recommend them to anybody looking for discounted sunglasses.
Don't act here as if you understand or are willing to solve the problem. When I write a mail of try to find any solution, the only thing I get as reaction is send it back. I don't want to make any more costs, but you don't react on that part. If you really understand and want to fix this, give me a refund on the extra costs. Ans send a new phone before I return the other. I'm still waiting for a real solution from you. Don't send me the same standard mail. I bought a cellphone Kingelon G9000, a Solar charger accupack and a Speedometer. All three are not working of not working properly. With the reclaim for my cellphone they are not very co-operating. I need my cellphone and I want a new one. I've paid extra by customs. Now I need to send it back on my own expence and also have to pay again for customs. That means the price of the cellphone will be twice as high. So at the end I've got nothing and paid al lot of money. I would recommend you not to buy anything with Everybuying!!!!! The aftersales is useless even when the fault is theirs. A very disappointed customer.
We decided to take a chance and buy a London Pass. We were please that we did.  We used the buses every day to travel to most locations from our accomodation. This was a free London tour in itself. Very convenient. You need to plan your day  and be prepared to have long days to get good value. We avoided long lines where possible because this would have limited our daily activity. Make sure you read and understand how to use the card, that way you will get the best value for your money.
I bought a alloy pipe, and that was damaged delivered by a customer of mine. A email was enough to resend a alloy pipe, now very well wrapped. I buy frequently at ASH, also for the good service they have.
I had ordered a Fujifilm X-20 compactcamera and an extra battery. After about 5 days (relatively quick all the way from Hong Kong), DHL(here in the EU)) brought the package at my home. Camera was good packed and everything works as it should be. As eGlobal.eu promises : the price on their site is the price you pay (and that's a lot less than the price here in Europe). they did a good job. Recommend! Thanxx
I ordered 2 maxidresses, they were very cheap, but now - even after washing - they keep their shape and colour #happy
I placed an order on the 23 februari. I did not get any order confirmation so I called them on monday and also send an email using there contact form. The calls are getting disconnected after a while. Eventually I spoke to someone about the order. They couldn't find it at first and said that there were some issues, but now the order is ok and I should receive an e-mail confirmation the same day. The order would be shipped on tuesday 25th of februari. Today, on thursday februari 27th , I still did not receive any confirmation about my order and shipment. I tried to contact hem multiple times by phone, but will get disconnected every time. They also did not respond to my email. This is my first time ordering something at FC-Moto, but I hope they will deliver...
Nice prices and they deliver very fast, even in the netherlands.
I myself live in the Netherlands, but as I was looking on site's for cheap perfumes I noticed that CheapSmells had the lowest prices out of all of them. And because I like to give a lot of perfumes for my family on Christmas, I decided to first order just one smell from them to check if I would really receive it and if the perfumes were original ones. Well I can tell you that I am very happy that I did, because ever since then I've already ordered three times from them! They have great smells, low prices, and quick delivery. I am definitely going to continue buying my perfumes from them!
It´s easy to find a hostel, and the reviews mostly reflect how a hostel is. Never had any problems with the payment or booking. And the most important of all: it has no booking fee, in contrary to another similar website.
Still amazed when ordering items that it is delivered that fast for a very reasonable price. Highly recommend.
I recently bought a prepaid card for swtor and was glad to discover it for roughly €10 less than most other places however i did not appreciate the small added fees that were not announced in any way shape or form on the main page granted it was only 30 something cents however it stil feels like false advertisement
Great delivery and really happy with the products Sure recommended for more people =)
De site is prima en de service is snel. Niks op aan te merken.
Good service in general! The only remark is that the address in the box was different than the address in the order and I almost did not get my product!!
Including shipping cost my item was cheaper than order it from a webstore in my own country, so I had it shipped over to Holland / the Netherlands. It was packaged very well, thank you for the pleasant purchase experience!
Despite of the stock difference in the warehouse, I got a call few days later from customer service that the goods were ordered again and 2 days later I received it by mail already.
Very good shop, always fast and nice response! Notified within a day when a product was not on stock, and found a solution in the same day via mail. Would buy again for sure :)
Ik ben tevreden met het product en met de dienstlevering, en de levering van het pakketje.
I am gratefull to the service which provided the packet even if they had the wrong information. That is good service. Cheers
I never plan a trip, holiday or whatever without checking Tripadvisor. Best ideas, tips and fine tuning ever.
Large collection and sharp prices. The website is hopelessly out of date. Design could use a big overhaul and filtering would be nice. Also could use more photo's per product and larger photo's of the products. But as long as they have the best prices I will be coming back!
hi,i am living in the netherlands,i found a super costume,beerman,for carnaval in februari it is nowhere to be found in the netherlands so i am very original....... the service of Escapade was super after ordering my costume was in three workindays at my home adress.
het was optijd binnen  maar ik kreeg de email een dag later dat die verzonden was
One of the only stores that had GTA V in stock.  I had it in a day!
I have been a regular Ebay buyer but pricing and customer service lacks with ebay. Buying with 118golf was and surely will be a pleasant exercise. Bought shoes that were defective after 5 months, sent them back to have them checked by factory and within 4 weeks I got new shoes returned, and I'm living in the Netherlands!!!! Fast, excellent replies on questions. Rate AAA+++ for me
A pleasant opportunity to enter New York's most wanted sites, at a reasonable price.
I have purchases a bear hat and mittens. Service and delivery were good but one of the mittens is of very poor quality.  Lots of loose threads with cause the mitten to fall apart if i don't fix them.. Since i ordered from the Netherlands i don't bother to send it back because of delivery costs. Hat and other mitten were fine though. Just bad luck i guess.
After having a few problems in Holland with ordering parts for my Acme brushless Auto I contacted the UK office and recieved a quick reply with all the information clearly shown with links on how to order the parts. I was further suprised that I recieved the parts within a week. Fantastic shall be ordering from the UK from now on
Ik bought a nice pair of Sidi shoes , Genius Mega size 43,5  colour white black and red, and the only place i could order them directly was with Wiggle, even in Italy i have to wait 3 months, now the delivery was in a couple of days, thanks Wiggle.
To own a piece of land in Scotland is wonderful, a great idea - highland titles makes it come true and offers a good service - quick delivery and complete information inclusive! I can recommend it without any reservations.
The order came a day earlier so that was a nice surprise. I love the free delivery on all purchases. I live in the Netherlands. Especially compared to other fashion sites, it makes purchasing more fun as I do not have to hit a certain amount. I am in contact with customer services about an issue and the mail correspondence is  neat and properly. Quick reaction as well.
A total shambles, see opinion in one sentence. Poor communication No service only thinking about the interest of 12, not the paying costumer
every birthday of ours sons we order a t-shirt with a name and a digit of their age. It became a yearly tradition. as per now we have about 9 t-shirts in our collection :-) And we are definetly going to keep up and order another one for the next b-day!
I was looking for a hotel and on this site the information was very complete and the prices were lower than on other sites. The confirmation mail is within seconds and very detailed.
If you need some club making items do not forget to see by Gamola, they have good stuff and their service is also good. Thanks, Alain
If you know what you want than order it by GolfstoreEurope, I am very pleased with the Mizuno JP 825 pro with the DG SL R300 shafts, they were bild as I wanted them and within the announced timing, thank you, Alain from Belgium
Quality under armour brand gear for cheaper prices if you live in the Netherlands even if p&p included. Very extensive assortment! Good and clear descriptions.
The wife and I have been in the market for some time now for new bedroom furniture. We have looked in stores and online. And one day we came across these guys. The furniture was of high quality. We were certainly worried about ordering from online and the furniture being as inexpensive as it is. It worried us it may not be of good quality. But it is great solid sturdy furniture at a fantastic price. Customer service was great they were knowledgeable of their product. And we were kept in the loop until the product arrived. I think this is one of the furniture buying experiences my wife and I have ever had. And we thank you guys for that!
I have bought a call of duty : black ops 2 steam key (cheapest on the web) and got it delivered within 1minute it worked straight away on steam i was very pleased. after enjoying it i decided to buy the season pass. when bought i was awaiting phone verification however i didnt get called. after 30minutes of waiting (which i didn't mind since i have my phone in my pocket and could just continue doing my things) i contacted the live chat which told me it was out of stock. i was a bit disapionted since their was no indication about the stock. i got offerend 2 things. wait until it got restocked or a full refund straight away. i decided to get a refund and buy it later when it gets restocked. G2A refunded all of my spend money straigt away. i was very pleased of this service since i have a fair amount of experience with webshops and alot of them give you a hard time trying to get a full refund. G2A Pros : - Fast delivery - Reliable - Cheap - Great customer service Cons : - No stock indication i hope this helped.
I bought several games now and I had no problems at all! The store is amazing! the cheap prices and within 30 minutes, you have the CD-Key for the game! well...how awesome is that? Even when you have a problem, they'll try to help you as soon as possible with the Online service, or with E-mail. So yeah...no downsides! I really recommend this to friends!
Nu nog even afwachten of de cartridges ook langer mee gaan
Precies wat ik wilde op het moment dat ik het wilde.
The envelopes arrived really fast and looked nice but were rather expensive.
I ordered swim suits and a bag. Price is good and easy pay with PayPal. Fast shipping makes it great. Best regards from the Netherlands.
All the books I find interesting and they come to me free of shipping charges. I like searching threw the bargain bin, and when I need a certain title it is always in stock. Perfect shop, I like it!
Just do it. all is good nice people good service. Quick at pick up and drop-off
I ordered two pair of Footjoy shoes. Delivery was in 6 days (including the weekend) Keep up the good work and service
2 times we rented a car with carhire3000. The second time we "saved the quote" we got and a couple of days later a sales representative called us to see if everything was allright. We got some good advice to prevent unnecessary double costs. Great service! It's always important to listen good to the airport representative otherwise you will definetely pay double for something you won't need!
A few weeks back I ordered some cell-phone covers. A friend told me about Mini In The Box, and I figured, why not try it as well. Most things are a lot cheaper than when I'd get them back home, and if you mind the amount of your order, you don't get tax-troubles. You know in advance that it'll take approximately 3 weeks to get it shipped, but that's worth the wait. I'm happy!
i like the promotions from cheapsmell as well as their quick service and good shipping rates. most times for free,depending on how much i spent.
They found the size I needed and got it to me for free within 3 days :) Couldn't be happier with my first experience shopping on Femalefirst! Love Fi
Unlike any other review I have seen here, I recieved the game within 5 minutes after paying with iDeal and a "Fraud Check" (where I did not need to do anything).  I just clicked on the provided link and accepted the gift on Steam.
Great place to get good clothing. I love it just handle some items with care.
For the first time I buy my e-liquids by Cloud9Vaping and with pleasure I visit there website, well-organized and easy to find what you want. The products they sell are from an excellent quality. Perfect, keep going this way.
Webshop contains all useful information you need combined with great pictures so you can really get an idea of the purchase you are about to make. Great functionality for easy ordering. Good delivery and return process (via UPS). And last but not least: ECCO delivers comfortable quality products!
These shoes are great! Superb quality! Order dec 19 and I was still waiting for the e-mail notifying me that they where dispatched when the doorbell rang and they where delivered only 3 working days later (in the Netherlands)!
Bought a great tandem pram here, for a great price (saved €200,- by ordering in the UK rather than in our home country). As we live in Holland, it was said to expect 7 workdays for delivery. We ordered on Sunday and on Tuesday, the package arrived! We were pleasantly surprised! The service was great: a clear instruction was given for assembly and they had even opened the manual on the Dutch page for us.
I like the skirt, the fabric is very easy to wrinkle and you can only iron cold. But I do love the skirt. The only thing I have a problem with for the second time is the shipping company on my side in my country. I already adressed them about it.
It was the last pair of Richbrook window winders they had, and I received a lot of useful info before buying. Now my classic sportscar has become still more attractive when I look at them. Thanks Rockshore ! Johan dW Belgium
I had to bring back the car with an empty tank. That was stressing me out because I almost ended up at the highway with an empty tank. The company is refilling the tank and that would cost me 75 euro. To my opinion that's way too much money. A complete refill does not cost that much.
In The Netherlands I could not find the product I wanted. On Kingofwatersports I found the perfect product for a reasonable price. And guess what? They delivered in my country! After paying through Paypay I received my product within a few days. The box was a little bumped, but the product was undamaged. I am very content with how my order has been handled. I would totally order again.
Site works really good and reminds you with emails for your stay and things to do.
Write as if you're speaking to a friend. No trouble with ordening and package received in good order
It took a long time to get the ordered item. Website indicate shipping within a day when ordering before their mentioned time. But that is not true, it took them three days before shipping. Also emails are not always answered, only in their benefit emails will be answered.
I orderd a present, on the website it said my package should be send the next day. This didnt happen. I sended a e-mail about the status and got no reaction. Now my pressent will arive too late. In the meantime my package still isnt send. and its 2 days later. I orderd because the artikle was on stock. If i look on the website now its off stock. So my first experiance with voelkner is a bad one!
Thanks to Vente-Exclusive another dream come true. Will definitely come back for more :)
I had a really satisfying experience flying to Rome. Nice and friendly crew. Because I’m tall they asked me if I would like to sit at the emergency exit to have more leg space.
I ordered a $300 phone at Pandawill 2 months ago which they claimed would be available the same week. After 4 weeks of claiming that it would arrive the next week, please wait 1-3 days, I didn't have the patience anymore and cancelled my order. Now the same is happening with my refund: We sent the money please wait 1-3 days thank you for your patience... Ordered my phone at a European dealer and had it in a week with good communication, never going to order from a chinese company again to save $50.
+ snelle levering + duidelijke info via mail + track & trace + tevreden over producten
Extremely convenient to order from one's armchair in a shop with a great selection and good prices.
definitieve beoordeling wil ik nog even mee wachten, cartridge zit er pas een dag of 2 in
I ordered somehting from the Netherlands and I think I got it within 4 days. Which I think is very fast. The customer service is also great so I have nothing negative to say!
I was very happy with my purchase of a haglofs jacket. Very speedy delivery. Goods as advertised. The mail updates were pleasant to receive. I am inclined to do business again.
supper snelle levering en ook heel erg up to date gehouden door spartoo.
I preordered Batman Origins CE and on the day of release, the parcelservice was at my door! Keep up the good work and I'll keep ordering from 12game.com, especially when the prices stay this sharp.
I am very pleased with this webpage. Nice clothing, ships fast, etc! No negative experiences at all.
Would recommend this service to everyone, I wouldn't risk a software jailbreak solution on an expensive phone. Ordered the unlocking service online and 4 days later my iPhone was factory unlocked!
The stuff at Optical Express was helpful and friendly from the very beginning, answered all my questions. I was totally not scared to undergo this eye laser surgery. Everybody in the clinique was friendly and helpful to me, the operation lasted maximum 10 minutes, the surgeons constantly encouraged me. They had to open my left eye once more to clean everything, but that didn't hurt. I would recommend this company, i experienced truly professionals working there.
is makelijk op elk moment van de dag ook snachts handig
Not a good and communicative company. Mailed many times and got some little answers. I did not trust them the way they communicate.
Highly recommended ! Delivery on time and in perfect condition as ordered. The receiver loved the bouquet!
I just keep coming back. I love their whole collection. And it is all good quality too! The delivery is very fast and I really like the fact that I can pay with iDeal.
Ordered a carseat from The Netherlands and got it within a week. Price is much cheaper than when ordered locally or in Sweden...
Quick service and never let me down so far... only thing i would like to see is the region the game comes from / where the key comes from :)
I ordered at Scorpion shoes for their wide range of shoes, competitive prices and also the shipping cost from London to Belgium was very low. I'll be ordering again !
Powertoolspares was the only shop were I could find my spare part ! Perfect transaction ! +++++++++ !!!
its a great store for buying games very cheap and if there would be a problem they solve it very professionally and very quickly
I was glad to be able to buy at British Corner Shop. Not everything I bought is easily to get in the part of the Netherlands where I life. Many things I ordered are for around Christmas. I look forward to that. I also want to say that the parcel was well packed, no trouble at all.
Nice product, nice product placement and a great support! Also my viewers increased because of sertain addons and also more potential costumers! I HIGHLY recommend the addon!
It was a warm welcome in our flat, not least because of the bright colours and the friendly host. The location was not too far from the center, so we could reach the exhibitions and the musea easily. It is a very quiet nieghborhood, and very near to the Hundertwassehaus, which is simpy wonderful. We might have wished a better functiioning bath, and a little cleaner toilet, but the kitchen was great, like the television and the free wifi. The appartment was not too far from the train to the airport, yet we decided to leave from our place with a taxi, that was kindly ordered by our hosts - with four persons it turned out cheaper..
The delivery is very fast en the product is very good. There was a problem though, first I got a jacket but the size was wrong for me. I was not able to sent it back because the return adress on the label was wrong, the parcell is still somewhere....
I'm so impressed with the excellent service that checkmyfile.com provided, at a much better value price than others in a simiar business. I was initially a little wary of signing up for a free 30 day trial for a credit report, as I thought it would be difficult to cancel if it wasn't what I was hoping for. I needn't have worried though as it was simple and clearly set out as to how you could cancel, and it was instant too, and you don't have to talk to anyone, it's all done online and literally takes less than a minute. I did actually sign up for a paid subscription, as I was so impresssed with every aspect of the service and I wanted to monitor my credit score going upwards as my financial situation improves due to positive circumstances in my life right now. My credit score via checkmyfile.com went up by about 30 points over a couple of months and it gives you such a boost to see, in front of you on the screen, proof that things are heading in the right direction money-wise. The checkmyfile.com website is really well laid out, easy to navigate, intuitive, and has a friendly feel. It has a wonderful splash of colour which seems to guide your eyes to different sections of each page, so that you can easily and effectively absorb the information. It's business-like and professional, but not at all scary or threatening like some other money orientated websites. You're treated like a person, not a number and it just feels "right". It was interesting to discover that the credit score that employers and landlords see is much higher than your regular score. I wondered at the time why I'd easily passed the search the estate agents carried out, but now I know! I've never actually wrote a review for a financial website before, but I was so impressed with checkmyfile.com that I wanted to tell others how awesome they are. If you're reading this and are considering signing-up for the free trial, stop thinking and start doing; you won't regret it. I didn't! Thanks for reading.
I stumbled across Lenstore whilst doiing a search for the contact lenses I was paying £21 a month for from my own opticians. Lenstore sold the exact same lenses for just over £30 for THREE months supply, so this worked out at a massive saving of £11 per month! I bought them, and they were here just 2 days later, superbly packaged, original, geuine quality! I always order from Lenstore now and will happily recommend them to all my contact-wearing friends. 100% happy.
The booking process was easy and they offered the sharpest rates for the hotel that I wanted to book. Good experience and I recommend this website.
The offer is ok but wen you buy from abrod there are many extra charges which make our buy extra expensive!
A super service and quality. The receiver told me that she had never seen such a beautiful piece of flowers. I ordered a "Primadonna bont groot" So I would definitely recommend Fleurop! What would even improve the service more would be a notification to the sender of receipt of the flowers.
I found out about Awesomebook via Amazon and decided to visit their site directly without going through Amazon. I was able to find a nice selection of second hand books for very affordable prices. In the following years I must have ordered about 3 cases of books and the experience was always enjoyable. I received my books on time and the quality was always as indicated on the site. Even when things go wrong, I didn't get the book I ordered, their customer service quickly rectified it.
Car hire in Kuwait,  no problems or what so ever
I had to provide all kinds of details just to buy a $10 game. Even the application process for my home rental was shorter
I made a car rental reservation with this organisation. When I updated my information with a slight change in flight arrival time, they claimed that this would be a new reservation, increasing the rental price with 83% (109 euro's.) A total rip-off.... My recommendation: don't use these guys....
Looking for a slow juicer in the Netherlands. But found the best option at UK Juicers. They had a good deal and had good reviews of the product and their company. Ordered on Thuesday and received the Hurom Slow Juicer HF-SBF06 on Thursday in Utrecht in the Netherlands. Well packaged and quick delivery. The product is great. And the company delivered as promised. So ordering from the UK works very well...
I buy my goods many years now on the Internet and I never encountered a company that was more customer friendly then HIFI-Tower. Keep up this good work and make the Internet an even more reliable place to buy your goods. Thnx again for everything. I shall certainly be back for more.
ik vint een goede service van dit bedrijf ga zo door  prima ok
I was looking for Hunter boots and saw the website of Attire. Interesting website with a good  range of boots and could make a choice. I can recommanded this website to you.
Overall great and fast service. Also great quality products for a good price! I will surely order again in the future!
have ordered many books the last 10 years and was never disappointed
Our first experience with Amoma makes certain that we look forward to the next meeting.
Ordered a 2nd hand Fender Stratocaster which was described as nearly mint and that is exactly what I received. Great service, thanks guys.
First time using the service and was very impressed in particular by customer services (Nina). Only improvement would be on prices.
I paid a very good price for my Diablo 3 but after some troubles with fraude detection (which wasn't the case) i had to wait over 7 hours before sombody off the support contacted me Othere from this i would say this is a great company keep it going!
Order was not delivered well. Did not get any reply after several e-mails. Did à telephone call, were I was told to get an answer next week, but now already two weeks later and Some reminding e-mail which are ignored.
This was our first experience with HouseTrip, recommended to us by a friend. Everything went perfectly ok: booking, payment and check-in. We had a wonderful trip.  What stands out is the very friendly phonecall and email from Housetrip two days before departing: this makes the online process of booking your holiday so much more personal.
The best air travel company for my opinion. The hostess are very nice and also the food. No waiting for so long time KLM fly  always on time I head no problems . My opinion Fly whit KLM and get the best service .
My total amount spent at paddock is over 5000 pounds. All products have been received and the ones that are not in stock were all refundend or shipped afterwards. You can always call if you need help with certain parts, but the website is super friendly and it is hard to get parts that are not for your vehicle. The only reason why my rating is 4 instead of 5: Some e-mails are left unanswered for more than a week. PS. I don't like the quality of BritPart that much, had some bad experiences. In your selection there is a lot of choice on manufacturor but not for all parts. Like the engine and gearbox mountings :(
Great service, very nice employees who are never too busy to answer any of your questions and, most importantly, great quality products!
We received the posters wrinkled, because the case was damaged during shipment. After an e-mail, we immediatly got the answers that the would replace the posters.
First time I bought something from Cox motor parts. Good price and very fast delivery, just a few days from ordering to delivery here in the Netherlands. After I placed the order they mailed me that there was a possibility to ship it on another way, saved me appr. 15 euro and received it right away back on my Paypal account. A supplier that thinks with you and saves you money, thats great!
My order was cancelled without reason and my money was not fully refunded. After months and several emails I am still waiting for the refunding of the shipping costs.
Ordered a ring with the request to deliver between 20th and 25th of October to Netherlands. Ring was only sent out on 22nd evening, which was already tight (royal mail indicates 3-5 days delivery time). The ring came too late and I had to return it, urgently buying a much more expensive ring at the airport. So, despite the good price and the good quality of the ring + diamond, my order only led to stress.
Lovely items, great prices. Living in the EU I did have to wait a bit for my order, but considering the great 5,95 flat rate for shipping to the EU I did not mind a bit. Communication was also fine.
three days before the booked half-day sightseeing tour in Dubai I confirmed the booking by telephone at the local operator. On the day of the excursion they called me in the morning at my hotel ,asked me  my room number and told me the pick up time at my hotel. The sightseeing tour in the afternoon was perfect.arranged.
Due to the lost of baggage through the airline, we left the airport very late. No problem for the taxi driver, who kept on waiting all the time. Even he offered help for a complaint. Very good transfer.
site was me tot nu toe onbekend, maar is aan te bevelen.
TransferWise is very user friendly and thus very easy to use. Everyone can do this. Besides that transferring the money went very fast. It took less then 2 days for me to transfer my money to my Dutch account. Finally, it saves you money!
I like the clothes on your website and looking at 'we like fashion.com' is my favourite time of the day! I love it that there is almost every day something new and still its clarifying. The delivery is very fast en the clothes look like on the website!!!! Thank you 'we like fashion.com'!!!!
Thanks for being so easy on the site and the order have a nice day
I recently bought an altimeter wallclock. Now each time I want to know what time it is when I am studying, I feel more motivation to continue because in the end I want to be looking at a real altimeter in the cockpit of an airplane I'm flying in.
I ordered a Lenskirt from Speed Graphic because it was nowhere to be found elsewhere. As a first time customer I'm well pleased. The Lenskirt was easy to find on the Speed Graphic website and it was easy to order and pay. Only a few days later I already had the Lenskirt in my home :-)! I therefore highly recommend Speed Graphic!
The people packing the items need their eyes tested. I received a 2 x 2 foot box of 996 engine parts vs a few stickers and bulbs for 911. No response the whole day after informing you and very disappointed customer.
Pleasant website with wide offer. Nice deals and fast oversea shipping.
Immediate, friendly, to the point feedback via e-mail. A replacement component (memory started failing 6 months after purchase) was sent the same day that I let them know of this problem.
Very pleased with Trailrunshop. They provided me more than once with excellent service on the phone. They helped me several times making a good choice of shoes.  Next to that the delivery is very fast. My first order was done around 16 o'clock. The next day around 12 c'clock I had my shoes. Will pay them a visit on my way to the Strong Man Run in Belgium in may.
I agree with some of the other reviews saying the prices are good but the service is poor. Although getting in contact with them was no problem for me the service and outcome are disturbing. The first time I placed an order I waited a week to get a ups code or something. But I did not hear anything from them so I contacted them myself to ask about the status of the order. I was told that there was a concurrent order and therefore had to wait a bit longer. They could have told me that the first week I suppose. Because I needed the shoes I canceled the order and got my money back. This was no problem and handled quickly. The second time I ordered 2 products during their discount period (21run-21). Very good price and I had the time to wait, so I was prepared. A few days later 21run.com mailed me to tell me the shoe was unavailable in my size. The offered me a refund or an other product. I was disappointed but told them that I would like to wait until the shoe was in stock again. Meanwhile I contacted the manufacture to ask if the shoe would still be available the upcoming months. Since the shoe was quite new the didn't expect an update till mid or late 2014. 21run.com however told me the manufacture was wrong, waiting was useless. The discussion was going nowhere. Therefore I agreed on the refund knowing that I will never order anything at 21run.com again. I orded the shoes for 20 euros more at an other store (trailrunshop.nl) and got very good service (by phone). Now, a week later l checked 21run.com to see if the shoe is still listed as available.... No surprise. They did not adjust the website, the shoe is still available in my size. Thats how serious they take their customers.
We ordered the samurai watches. One of the boxes came dented (they are metal) so as a gift, it looks ugly. Each of the watches was packed differently so it makes you wonder if they are "really" new.
Sometimes I try an other browser and search engine.....to realise that Google is so great. Also the agenda and other Google tools are really usefull and efficient....I love Google.
I use Paypal on moments that I want to make an fast and secure payment by the internet....and it works great!
Before I ordered what  wanted I made a phone call to get some information. I was helped very friendly and politely and get the correct information indeed.
I was shocked by a terrible news about my friends lost, his brother passed away unexpectedly and been thousands miles away and not be able to support him, made me very sad and the only thing I could think of was to send him my sympathies with flowers and believe me, this is very simple and very good way to show your presence and friendship and Flora Queen is the right place for such thing. Highly recommended!
I ordered a dress and wanted it delivered in Canada. It was delivered within 5 working days and the dress is beautiful. Information on the webside is correct, it sais that the dress has a small fitting so I ordered size 14 instead of 12. It fits perfectally. Information they gave me by telephone was correct too. I am satisfied and will order again.
Ik ben zeer te vreden over de bestelling die ik gedaan heb. Van het begin tot dat ik het in huis had was het heel correct en overzichtelijk om te bestellen en te ontvangen
I'm very happy with the key I bought from CJS-CD-Keys.com! The only thing that might need some work is the sms authorisation since that didn't work. Switched to authorisation by phone on a different number and that worked perfect!
I came across Milanoo.com some time ago by chance. There were some nice products  on the cheap. Before ordering anywhere for the first time, I always check for reviews of other customers online. The negative reviews obviously worried me, but the positive reviews made me want to take the risk. What struck me was that a common cause for complaint was size. Since Milanoo is China-based, it seems the size-charts have to be scrutinized very carefully. Sizes are different from Europe or US. I ordered 2 hoodies, a t-shirt, pair of jeans and a shirt. I'm usually either a L or XL, so I opted for the XL when ordering the hoodies. One of them fits me just fine, the other one is on the small side. Will order XXL next time, if they have them. The jeans and t-shirt fit just perfectly, same size as in Europe. The shirt was too small for me. Overall for clothing, the arm length is smaller. Four out of 5 isn't bad, especially for this money. Shipping was also fine. I ordered dec 31st and received my package with DHL on jan 14th. Two weeks, as expected. Also, I didn't have to pay any customs fees - phew! Overall, quite pleased.
I pre-ordered two pairs of Nike's ... but only one pair arrived on time, due to problems with Nike. Since I had to wait quite a while for the second pair, End payed back the delivery costs. Great service, no doubt about that!
I was positively surprised when my order arrived almost the next day. An example many other online shops should follow!
Ordering was very easy and I was surprised by the fast shipping as I live in the Netherlands. Everything was packaged very well. Would definatley order again!
I have been using one.com since probably around 1999 or 2000. I now manage about 10 websites with one.com; moest of them are for e-mail only. I've always been very happy with support - they are quick and friendly and will help you until there is a solution. Very little downtime (and they give you ample notice). I tend to read small prints when I sign a contract so have never been surprised by the fact that hosting usually costs a little more from the second year on (it's still cheap!). I understand that if you want to make a really elaborate website, there are better options - but for me and my small business, it more than suffices.
Living in the Netherlands i was and still am very pleased on how fast the delivery was. I have some really beautiful clothes (getting the compliments) plus the fact that there very cheap. Love it!! Keep up the great work!!!
everything went well. The items arrived one week after the promised date of delivery with Three days delay between the two items. Good customer service ant the items are really good.
my girls are very pleased with the suits. nice, warm, fluffy and a very good service.
Never been led down by Hostelworld, they have always managed to find me a hostel, three continents and counting...
Communication with seller is ok - replied to my requests. However, the office chair I bought was of extremely low quality, I would not pay 15 euro for it if I saw it real. Pictures and description were really nice but did not at all correspond to reality and price I paid. Chair arrived disassembled in a box, with many plastic broken pieces, while other were scratched, so called "leather" was just a piece of scorchy material, sitting place feels like wooden bench, all is so low-level! Return conditions are tricky. Not all carriers will take a box of +25 kg from a private person to ship to a neighbour country. Not as it was advertised on site, that return postal expenses are 8 or 16 euros depending on the size of the parcel. The only offer I found was over 37 euros, which is 1/3 the price of the chair. Plus, I had to find someone who can carry such a heavy box to the post! Sellers did not advise on cheaper sellers- ignored my question, and replied immediately when I was about to ask for exchange of broken pieces to live with it. But when I took everything out of the box, I did not need those pieces anymore. Uncomfortable, cheap chinese fake - for an exorbitant price. Shame! So I ended up throwing this chair out, as it cannot be used nor returned. Would never buy from this site again. Basically gave sellers a gift of over 100 euros. I fully regret my choice of the website.
You can find the best deals on Zalando Lounge. If you really want to get the deal asap, do no not choose Zalando Lounge, but if you can wait, than I definitely can recommend the site.  I do not have any aftersales experience.
This is the first time that I ordered something from abroad (an international webshop). As I was a bit reluctant how long the shipping would take, I received my package within days. I could trace the package by DHL.I definitely can recommend Fab.com.
After Dr. approval  and check back order was dispatched within 24 hours. . and arrived within 24 hours too...... not as as cheap as Dr. Fox  but sure faster for the  money you pay......
Handling of the order and speed of delivery is satisfactory. I didn't experience any problems. I will order again if I need anything.
I shipped 24 boxes of household items from Europe to New Zealand and was very satisfied with the Seven Seas experience. Even the pick up and delivery drivers were really nice guys. At all stages of the process the email and phone (including SMS updates) were informative and timely. The provided instructions, forms, boxes and material were exceptional. Seven Seas needs to be more transparent with their NZ "inspection charges", I couldn't get a clear answer after many emails but the fees are reasonable so I remain satisfied. I would not hesitate to recommend Seven Seas for your international relocation needs.
I found the site by mistake. Mark has been very patient and hyper pro in helping to define a configuration. What they promise is what they do ! and I even got a home delivery by Mark himself. Very rare to have such an excellent service...and equipment !!
Recently bought the Soundlink Mini. Really amazed by the quality/power of the sound, it's like magic looking at the size of the speaker. The build quality is top notch as well and the battery appears to be replacable, so the product is there to last for years (Apple could learn something here from BOSE). One of my favorite usages is to connect an iPad to the Soundlink mini and watch some television/series in the bath tub after doing some sports :)
It's the fastest way to travel from Amsterdam to Paris. Service is good in 1st class and the seats are as well. But the advertised free WIFI does not work at all. Extremely slow and/or not working, not that handy when traveling for business. NS (Dutch Railway) does a much better job with their integration with t-mobile, which also works within stations.
Although some delay going to Stockholm the quality of the staff and FREE WIFI made up for this. Website could be more user friendly as well.
Ordered some products in February, got an e-mail response that things were out of stock, but there was an alternative. So replied that that would be fine. Still after 1 month no products at all and also no response to my e-mails requesting an update.
Recently bought a Bose Quiet Comfort 15 and could test it right away in the plane on my way to my holiday address. Smart that the Plane music adapters are included, so I could watch all the on-board movies with super sound quality. Unfortunately I had some small children on the row next to me, but also these sounds were nicely cancelled so I had some good sleep as well :)
Booked my tickets to Tanzania (direct flight) through KLM. If you compare the pricing versus the flight time, I think KLM most often has the best deal. Also took the option of comfort class flying to Tanzania and took some more leg space when traveling back to the Netherlands. Flight was perfect, food was great and the AMAZING entertainment system had all the movies available which I still wanted to see! On the way back there were some small children in the row next to me, the steward brought me some ear-plugs. That's what service is all about.
Hiring a car has never been that easy. Good car for a good  price, all insurances covered and no hassle delivering it back. Not many people have discovered it yet, although jou see  a lot of cicar cars on the road,  but the queue at the desk was non-existing, whereas for the more expensive compagnies there was a big queue.
this is a site you must go to for all your golfitems...
I was informed that the parts I had ordered had been sent, this is after the item was guaranteed to be sent the same day. I needed the parts urgently for a client which I stated in the comments block- needless to say I received a notification the following afternoon to say they did not have the part- thanks, I lost a client.
Very nice company and kind people to do business with. Despite my part was not in stock, they kept me posted every week or so about the status. Will definitely do business again! I highly recommend fotokoch.de
Ordered one day, delivered within the UK the next and in great condition. Perfect!
Indigocarhire is great for every young driver that doesn't want pay high fees because they are under 25. Throw the site of Indigocarhire i chatted with Rob he, looked the best option for me and made it happen in five minutes.
International delivery (from order to doorstep) within two working days; now that's what I call prompt and excellent service!
I ordered from The Netherlands. I received my order in 48 hours which is great. Customer service speaks perfectly English. Nice people and they are very helpfull.
Had to get a flight to Cairns within 24 hours. Went to Townsville airport to get myself a ticket. The lady at the desk was very helpfull and very friendly,gave me multiple choices when to fly as in departure time. Was informed correctly by Qantas staff they gave me an other seat as said and the reason why. Even asked me if I was OK with it. Good flight which included an apple and a bottle of water even tho the flight took just  one hour. Friendly staff at the plane,very helpfull to an disabled woman.
The hoodie I ordered arrived quickly and is comfortably warm.
I can only find a Danish site, so I will leave my comments here. I ordered my photo's and calenders in Holland on Foto.com, and when I remember correctly, the photo's were sent from an address in France. The photo's and calenders were cheap compared to other websites. The quality looked okay on the screen, but when I received the shipment I found the quality very poor. My photo's were 5MB recent photo's and  excellent, but especially the photo's used for calendars were pale and disappointing.
I have bought several keys from them over the past year and can only say I'm really happy with them. They have never at any point let me down, their support is really quick to help you if things don't work out (hehe, O and 0, how could I not see it?) and, most importantly, their prices are most often the lowest out there! Count me in as a fan! :)
3 times I have order something and they are always super fast with everything .tops
For years I had problems with the noise of the traffic through the street I live in. That continues through the evening. It kept me awake during the evening, or woke me up early. I tried many brands of earplugs, and even tried custom prepared earplugs specially designed for my ears (100 euro a set). But all of them did not work because of the pressure they induced caught my attention during the evening, so that kept me awake. The finest ear plugs work much better. I cut one earplug in two pieces and use one piece for every ear. The good thing is that I could decrease the size further by pinching off small pieces. It took some practice to make the perfect fit, so that the sounds get blocked and I don't feel the pressure. But then they are the best plugs I ever tried. So in short it can take some trial and error to get the perfect fit, but then the results are awesome. I don't feel that they are present, they just do what they should do: block out the noise of the cars and trucks. And they can be reused a few weeks at least. When I ordered them, they came within the 10 days that was promised. I will buy them next year again.
As said in the headline. Probably I'll order a next time from this company and would recommend this company to my friends too!
My order was shipped to Holland. The delivery was fast and very correctly. A satisfied customer
dat is al heel wat tegenwoordig! need I say more.
Great online shop with good costumer service and very quick shipping
Ordered a few times from Kompressor and I must say they deliver what they promise for a very affordable price! Fast delivery and fast response to email questions. Definitely going to order from Kompressor again!!
They have a variety of styles from Asia, all sorts of clothing, jewlery, shoes, accessories. It's all easy to find on a nice and professional site. And best of all, there are a lot of pictures for each item. Everything is shipped on time and the prices are really good. A must shop for anyone.
Generally shipping takes long, between 11 and 34 days, 30 days on average. The items I received were great, I rely on the reviews people give as Fasttech doesn't remove negative reviews. They also have a forum where people can talk freely about the items being sold. Two times I had problems with a shipment, once a missing item and once a broken item (glass part). In both cases I got a refund. I ordered here many times, they sell authentic items (authentic is in description then) and clones. Can recommend fasttech if you are willing to wait a bit until you receive the item.
My item didn't get delivered and the only asked me to wait and wait. It took already 10 days before the shipped the item despite the website said the item was in stock. They asked me to wait longer than Paypal allowed me to open a dispute and while doing some research on the internet I learned that this is common practice for them. When I opened a dispute they never responded, upgraded it to a claim and Paypal refunded my Money. Thank you Paypal!
A really good site with a lot of different swimmingwear! Good delevirance - The only bad thing is that you ship international but the site is only in French! Also whan you want to return your delivery!
My order within five days got home, the service is very fast! but klaliteit was disappointing. the ride of my bag was broken after weeks.
It is always a pleasure to buy at Bax-shop! They got quality items at the best prices and you always got it quick home!
The recipient was really pleased, said they are lovely, smell lovely and the photos showed they were lovely! Really appreciated that the company kept me informed of delivery progress.
No problem with finding what i needed and the delivery was perfect on time
- clear side - quick finding of products. - fast delivery - general professional
I ordered a polarbuff and it came to me in excellent state. The shipping was fast too. I would recommend this webstore.
I've ordered numerous shipments of Pokémon cards from Card Team, and the last 2 shipments have all been delayed in shipping out for some reason or other (last time over a week between ordering and shipping out, this time more than 2 weeks). The customer service is good, though, with fast answers. Both times, though, I was promised 'additional goodies' to make up for the delay. This did not really happen. Last time I didn't receive any extra's, and this time only 1 booster pack (on an order of over 400 euros). The lack of goodies doesn't bother me, but don't promise something like that in an email if you're not going through with it. I will, however, keep ordering here, most likely, because their prices are really good, and shipping & handling to the Netherlands is fast (once shipped out it takes only 2 days) and affordable.
I have ordered some very nice clothes for my son. He looks great in them. I am betting that from all kids at this wedding, he looks absolutely best. I am most certainly returning as soon as he needs his next pile of clothes... Greetings, Patrick
We ordered a invitation size A5 and it was send the time and place as was promised. No complaints, nice work!
Great selection available on the website and very easy to navigate. Very quick dispatch of items. Any returns always refunded promptly.
Voor ik het wist lag het pakje al in de bus. Geweldige snelle service
Ik had een track en trace nummer verwacht en de status van de bestelling
Took me two weeks and 4 tries to get the package in my hands, the delivery guy showed up 4 hours later, did not show up at all, did not call me before arriving when i particulary asked for that.. The delivery company caused that I will probably not order something from Boohoo anymore.
we were very satisfied and we will order from you again.
Ik ben heel erg tevreden over de snelle levering en ook over de kwaliteit van de aanbiedingen.
didnt got the product in stock, they are very rude on the phone,  the only solution is wait ore cancel the order.
Love BeautyBay, they offer a wide range of products that I wouldn't be able to buy here in Holland. 2 Downsides; the first is the time of delivery, it says 5-7 days, but with my last order it took about 3 weeks (though my first order did take 7 days, so it is possible). Second downside is payment; I don't have a creditcard and I don't want to get one either, so I prefer to pay with PayPal. With BeatyBay you have to order for a minimum of £35,- to be able to pay with PayPal. I would prefer to pay with PayPal every time and not just with bigger amounts.
An easy and helpful way of making a reservation for a ferry.
I have ordered several times now and all occasions it was delivered fast and complete and the price is good here! I did receive 'deluxe' samples (for free International Express Service on all occasions, so had spent quite a bit of money), but would have liked to have the samples to be more 'deluxe' and when spending this money a bit more samples would have been nice. That's the only criticism I can think of... otherwise: GREAT!
Pretty good pricing and fast shipment although the shipping fee to Holland could be lower. Hope there will be an amazon.nl soon!
I ordered a jacket on thursday . It was delivered on monday . Swift and correct. Only difference with other orders was that this time I didn't get a mail when the order was shipped. I can recommend the firm
Deblauwedeel is recommended to anyone wanting to purchase quality period items such as furniture or lighting.  Superb webshop service!
Schoenen besteld in de winkel en na een dag al in huis, prima service
it is a good product en we have lost weightand we didn't have had complications.
I was looking for a site who had paypal and I asked on a forum for it. They said go take a look at this site so I did . I noticed that the price was way lower then all other sides so It sounded like a good deal. I order with paypal and I inmediatly got a link were I could find the code. Low price fast service PERFECT!
Amazon does what it should do, sometimes packages get lost or take forever to be delivered, but that is a customs issue. One of the problems of not having a local office in the netherlands.
If you like premium brads with premium quality, Apple is the one for you. they produce excellent products to create a fullfilling user experience. Yes it is true I like apple products, not a big fan of OSX, but it does what it is suppose to do and the hardware looks good. The thing I like most about Apple is: whatever you buy, it will be a carefully thought out product. If you wil love it is another question but it will be one of the very best in its class. you can buy apple products almost unseen.
My experience so far, flying from Wheese to Venice, was: you get what you pay for. No real service, and you pretty much have to sort out everything yourself. But if you do, you get a decent flight for little money. Be prepared to live without any comforts before boarding and during the flights. bus services to pick you up, make sure you got coins of local currency for all the extra stuff they do not mention. Like how to get from their private airport to the actual destination. You get what you pay for, really, it is that simple.
I had some questions about an order by email and recieved great help. My order came through exactly as promised, bang on time (in the Netherlands) and at very competitive prices. What more could you want?
By FAR the WORST online purchase i have EVER done!!! Who would give simplyelectronics 4-5 stars?? Probably ones who are paid to do so. It is almost 1 month since they promised to DELIVER my order (“please expect 5-10 days for you to have your order“). We are now counting 20 days and the order hasn't even been shipped yet. Now, mistakes can happen, and if the feedback / dialogue is specific and honest, it is tolerable. But the ONLY mails I have received has been along the lines of “will send it very soon“ and “within next week“ and “we are looking into the problem“ - obviously automatic standardised emails. I find this experience - both service and promise of delivery - far below average and I will NEVER recommend anyone I know or ANYONE here to do their purchase at simply electronics - even if it means saving a bit of money.

Been waiting for a Crysis 3 Hunter Edition for 2 months and still have not received the key. Ordered it half a year ago. Contacted them via their site form, via their admin mail account. Even send my picture with my ID without them requesting for it. Not a word. Losing confidence that I am ever going to see or hear something positive about it. So still waiting... Later: contacted them via their e-mail adres reported in my PayPal acount. Got a support-system ticket! Got a response! So this is the way to go... Got 110% of my purchase back in with a coupon code. Ordered Battlefield 4 with it. I hope they have setup a watertight system that won't forget pre-order buyers. Still giving them a chance to prove them.
ordered avent breast pumper for competitive price with nice delivery service from ups, however, confirmation emails took some time. i gave 5 stars for international trading in english.
the webshop is good, the price is good, and they offer also free worldwide free delivery,.i order often in this webshop
i always buy makeup via ebay, they are much cheaper than here. the price is amazing and delivery is ok. the service is good.
i have placed an order before, but because they are out of stock, i have asked refund, they refund me within 24 hours. so i came back and placed another order, the products are amazing, price is a little bit expensive but the service is really good.
It's the zero customer service company, that in case of delays or cancellations will not reimburse you anything, even when you present them with the official law rules.
These guy sell half website script that are not ready and they only say, well, email the developper. These guys are crooks!
I have bought multiple games from G2Play.net I got the keys within a few minutes and could start playing! Once i had a problem (not their problem) but they helped me all the way through until i could play my game, a great and fast customer service! I will continue buying here and recommend it to anyone who loves cheap games.
ik vond het jammer dat ik ze een dag te laat kreeg,
I would recommend this company to anyone! very very good service
There is no doubt that is a good product. The core is great and does what is should do  and that is showing photos. The disappointment is in the available skinns. It looks like jAlbum depends heavily on other devellopers to make skinns. A lot of these skinn are old. There are a very few skinns that are build as a responsive skinn and with all available tech of today. It's a lot of the same and very old. From the hundreds of skinn there are less then 10 you can use today, the rest is to old to take seriously. It would be better if some in-house develloper would make some modern skinns, because this is a disappointment.
from day one till treatment and check-ups were very clear and understanable
Dit is echt een aanrader en het is ook nog goedkoop!
The item I ordered was out of stock and I was offered an other item or a refund. Due to a change of personnel I heard nothing for a while. But after one email from me. everything was correctly and very quickly solved. As a customer from abroad I was a first a bit worried but after this positive experience I can recommend The Scotland Kilt Company.
door staking duurde het wat langer ,maar voor de rest ben ik tevreden met de levering
This could be such a great product if the service was as good as well. The company offers a downloadable voucher to give as a gift. It is non-decript and very boring voucher. The receiver would not really know what it was meant for. Thus, difficult to give as a gift. I had looked at the price of the lunch box I had in mind. €12.99. The only option was to buy a voucher for €15.00. So I did that. And what happened next - my son designed his own lunch box (from Santa Claus) and had to ask me to come and pay extra with my card as the postage was not covered. This is not marketing savvy! This is a lovely product - just the rest needs to be tweaked!
our bankaccount was verified by Skrill in June 2013, nothing has changed since then, but our Skrill account is blocked since October, all of a sudden we need to get our bankaccount verified again without any reason. we never get any reply to our emails, now they claim the emails were sent from a different emailaddress, they could easily have returned the emails, but they did nothing, they just wanna keep our money, don't use Skrill, they're thieves!
As a beginner it is perfect to learn, like the explanation from the instructors on the video's. I found it a very quick way to learn and as a beginner you will play very quickly a nice song on the guitar. I would highly recommend it to everybody.
It is very easy to book via booking.com. I use them always - and it is rare that we are disappointed with the hotels.
The ordering with batteryupgrade.com was good, also the payment was easy (in the Netherlands with iDeal) and delivery was also good.
Auto Europe has a great website with an easy to handle navigation and the amount of cars they offer are good and for a good price. The communication regarding your order is clear and the service is good.
Zeer tevreden over de levering en de kwaliteit van het product
What a worthless service! I ordered a dvd in the beginning of April. Had to wait for 4 weeks to receive a completely wrong dvd, one that i did not order. Had to call to get a return number. Send back the dvd (postage costs more then 7.50 pounds because it was shipped from The Netherlands). Well, that's was a week ago... Still no update and no dvd. Just received a message from Paypal that Zavvi put back the money of the dvd (only) on my creditcard. But what about the delivery costs and the return postage costs??? No information on my order/return at all. Totally worthless!! I will never ever order here anything ever again.
I thought it would be nice to try Guild Wars 2 in the weekend (the weekend before last). Gameholds seemed like a good option price wise, And obviously has good reviews. Paid through paypal. For some reason this turned into a delayed transaction 4-6 days. So no gaming for me that weekend. Which might have more to do with Paypal than Gameholds, although I never experienced anything like this before Payment was finally done, according to Paypal and I received a message from Gameholds thanking me for my purchase and if I would like to review their service here. But..... no game key. Logging in at gameholds, stil had my order status on 'Verification' so I e-mailed them asking about this. They couldn't find my payment. Asked me for my paypal account e-mail. Then nothing. I mailed them again with my paypal transaction reference number. Again they couldn't find anything. I have to say they responded quite quickly but not with the answer I was looking for. So I suggested that I would try to let paypal get my money back through the complaint service. Gameholds basically said: "Go ahead" Now I have to wait til 6 dec, for gameholds to reply to my claim... But I have a feeling I can kiss my €34,88 goodbye
The order was received promptly after a couple of days. Too bad you are not allowed to order more than 2 bottels of cough syrup. The shipment is free when you order more.
I sold two tickets for a concert in SeatWave. I made a mistake while uploading the tickets and they called me. We quickly solved the issue. This made me trust even more in the service!
ben tevreden over de kwaliteit ven het produkt en de levering
I use Nuratrim for two weeks now and lost 4 pounds with a normal dieet. I lost my appetite for snacks and eat only what I need  and drink a lot of water and green thee. II feel great  with absolutely no side effects.
I needed a new Motor for my Kenwood Kitchen machine but it was hard to find. With the help option of eSpares I got it in my shopping Basket in 30 seconds. That is what I call GREAT SERVICE. Within a week I received it from my local Postman in a small village in the Netherlands. This was the second very good experience I had with eSpares. Therefore I recommand them to everyone who needs spare parts for whatever machine. Tjitze Piekema
Goede levering netjes via de mail op de hoogte qua levering
Price of items is great. Only disappointment I had was that the item was out of stock and I had to wait 3 days before I got it. Site showed it was available, while in reality it was not. Availability needs to be refreshed/updated more frequently
I could recommend this webshop to anyone interested in gaming. I can be very short with this; The service is just outstanding. You pay, and within moments after the payment you already receive the purchased item. The price is very good, aswell.
I am satisfied about the service of Worldremit. Laila and Nicole, thank you very much !! Kind regards, Jan
I orderen on tuesday evening and had the china in my kitchen on friday, living in the Netherlands! Very carefully wrapped so in perfect state. Very very content!
I am a customer who lives in Belgium and got my order in 7 days and they told me that it would take 10 days or longer, so that's excellent service. Had several times contact with them via email and received an immediate reply to my question. fast, cheap and good service! And received a discount for my next purchase with my order of '-50 pound'
It's always a pleasure to search for new old books. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find out exactly wich edition the book is...but most of the time you can just try it, because of the low price. Free shipping even to the Netherlands is great.
I ordered the hazard 4 toiletry bag, and had it in my hands in 3 workdays
Ik had een poster besteld en de levering was prima in orde.
Just wanted to leave my thanks and appreciation for Boden's team, on helping me with some issues with ordering, and patience as our credit card company fumbled our account details delaying authorisation for up to a month. But Boden managed it all really wel, and I am looking forward to the summer clothes for our girls.
Because I was not yet fully done with the design for my new cards and still needed them for an event, flyerzone helped me out with finishing the design. Many thanks. It turned out great.
There was a problem and I receive something that I didnt order, and was refunded the payment very quickly with no difficulty.
Great service, I ordered a itunes gift card for the US and within minutes I got the code and could redeem this in itunes store. Therefor a 5star rating, no complaints at all.
With a slight delay i received all my goods and had the possibility to change an item. Good e-mail contact. And reasonable switch of items because ordered item was sold out.
I love Ecco shoes, all the range from chic to sportshoes. Once ordered I have them in my house within five days. To anyone with footproblems I would say ' try a Biom shoe' !
Transparent order - fast delivery - fair prices - outstanding brands and quality
I ordered a lot of stuff from this site and Heinnie always delivers fast. I would order again.
ik was blij met de snelle service en levering van het product. en de overzichtelijkheid van de site is ook uitstekend.
I find the deals very nice and the prices are very competitive. The fact that you install it so easely with Steam is a very great advantage.
It was the first time I used the website hostelworld and I do not have one complain! Gonna use the site again at the end of the summer.
Also this order was fast in Holland and the prices are cheap!! When I need tools, for certain I go first to Toolstop.
I ordered a Citizen Skyhawk AT Blue Angel on Monday at 23:00 hr. The order/payment acknowledgement came  the next day and the watch arrived in good order  the following day. That's good service. Unpacking it, I noticed the blue colour is lot darker than the web shop shows, so I searched the net (again) in this respect. Then by accident,  I discovered the watch was  offered over 40 cheaper at another store. I considered sending it back and contacted FCW service late that night. The following morning FCW refunded the full difference without any hassle. That's what I call great service! Thanks FCW.
I live in Holland and the delivery was way faster than expected. I love my new onesie, too!
De levering was zeer snel, had de trampoline de volgende dag al thuis! De trampoline is geweldig!
De A4 losse glansbladen met software op de MAC levert een prima resultaat op.
When you're not exactly small or even medium, there is no better place than this to come and buy stylish, trendy clothing, especially if you have no time to visit their real shop. The website, in many ways, is even better as here you also have great suggestions of how to combine individual pieces into a coherent outfit that will suit your personality. Honestly, once you give it a go, you'll sign up for the newsletter and always keep on eye on what's new at M&S!
I'm really glad it exists as it makes life easier for people who work long hours and don't have time to cook.
Beautiful shoes, really suitable for people with narrow feet (smalle voeten) and a low instep (lage wreef). De only sneaker I can wear and that looks great on my feet! The service of the webshop is great, fast deliverey, clear and easy ordering. No need to make an account, I hate having all those accounts for web shops. I'm really happy with my purchase and satisfied with the way the order was processes. (and nice wrapping). I will definitely order again.
The d-mannose this company offers is pure and without additions. Many other companies sell d-mannose tablets with a gelatin coating, which, as a vegetarian, I don't like. That is why I prefer Naturesupplies tablets. The product comes neatly packaged and shipping is fast. International shipping only took a week, and that includes the time for the payment to come through. I will continue to order my d-mannose with Naturesupplies, as not a single company in the Netherlands can offer it at these prices. D-mannose has helped me a lot. I have chronically recurring bladder infections, without any treatment I have 10-20 infections a year. With a daily dose of d-mannose, this is reduced to about 1-3 infections a year. This is a large improvement and I will continue to take the tablets every day.
Ordered two pairs of Nike golf trousers, because the size I needed them in was in stock. I order often golf gear in the UK and is has always been without any problems. The trousers look great and fit well and, as said, ordering was also without any effort.
Fast reply and really safe. As I made my order there was some confusing with my identity so I was asked to send copies of official documents to be sure it was me and not a fraud with my pay account. My 5 stars for fast replies and great security.
You delivered flowers a day before the birthday of my friend. Next to that, you called her before the delivery to tell her the flowers are comming. Why did you do that? Its the 30th birthday of my friend and we agreed with a whle group of people to send her a lot of flowers on her birthday. By calling her and especially by delivering the flowers a day before, you spoiled all surprise. I order flowers for friends on a regular basis. This time was the first and definitelly the last time I will be using Euroflorist.
While going through the online booking we experienced this issue, If we wanted to change a departure day we had to fill in all the details again.
Within 4 days my order was shipped and 2 more days for delivery. So it took 6 days in totall.  Tracking was possible from order to delivery and all in between was monitored. For me this was a very nice way to do business. When needed, I surely will order again at this shop
Placed a order on saturdaynight. Monday they where shipping and on wednesday there where in my home! And this is in The Netherlands so this is extreme fast! Maybe a tip for you guys, send the tracking number automatically by email from your magento shop (it's a built in feature). Now i was wondering where my shipment was and i needed to contact you by e-mail that also was replied within a hour so also credits for that. Keep up the good work!
I bought a item that was damaged during transport. Contact DX and they send me a new item. Perfect after sales!
I order a lot of books here and I can honestly say that they have great service. Books are always delivered on time and in good condition. If you have any problem whatsoever just mail them and they will help you!
I have ordered tiles, adhesives and mats for my kitchen and conservatory refurbishment. I found the products exactly as described and very much like photos on the website, however the delivery was far from perfect. First shipment - tiles. Arrived on the day but the driver off loaded the whole pile in front of the house and left my partner alone to move packs of 60x28cm tiles (total of 20m2) alone to our flat up the stairs (raised ground floor). When we finally had floor ready to install tiles (month later) we found that 2 boxes had tiles removed so we were 2 tiles short (again 60x28 is not a small tile), secondly we discovered that one pack had 2 tiles broken... luckily we ordered spares as we had lots of cutting so at the end whole floor was covered. Second delivery adhesives and mat... well... that was epic. I have missed delivery and we had to reschedule for saturday. It came out that on saturday there are different drivers and I couldn't get on hold of anyone who would tell me where my delivery is (as I had already builders waiting)... At the end I got on hold of driver who tried to deliver to us when we missed delivery and he was helpful enough to contact driver who suppose to deliver to us on saturday. What a surprise we had as we were told goods were delivered. I came out of the house to check did any neighbors picked it up for us and found that everything was dumped behind fence in our front garden!!! Anyhow, the goods were not demanded so it was all okish. Sadly mat looked like someone blind tried to cut a straight line as well we ordered 7.5 meters and we received... 3 cuts of 2.5 :-( well disappointed. I had lots of off cuts :-( waste of money.
Overall, I'm not pretty happy with the things that I ordered.. I'm always a medium size, so I always order M. But it never fits! It's always too small or way too big. I don't get this. From now on I'm only ordering jewelry and accessoires at boohoo.nl. Too bad because I really like the clothing :(
I'm living in The Netherlands and ordered some products by Rate Healthstuff. In just a couple of days I received my order in a perfect state at home. Thanks for the quick delivery!
de service was goed en de levering ook ik ben zeer tevreden
Trip Advisor is always the right reference for the traveller. When we plan a holiday the first procedure is to check hotels, restaurants etc, with Trip Advisor - The site is excellent and you can trust the information from Trip Advisor and from  the opinion of the members.
9gag is simply a collection of funny jokes, images and stories that are very relatable. Simple. but effective and highly entertaining!
My personal experience with Apple products (Ipods, Macbooks, iMac) have been extremely positive. Never any breakdowns, good battery life good design. The only thing I dont like is the magic mouse without a right mouse button. But overall: their products are amazing and higly recommended. On the Apple site you will rarly come across some special deals like a free ipod touch with you macbook. However, this does not happen often enough. Give us more discount please!
It is really convienient to not having to buy tickets everywhere.
Being Dutch, I know a lot about windmills, wooden shoes and tulips. Buying a kilt is somewhat out of my comfort zone. I was looking for a kilt for my 77-year-old dad who will wear it on a special occasion. Fortunately I found buyakilt.com and I am very, very pleased with my purchases. The kilt and the rest of the outfit I ordered are of a very good quality, I never expected to get something this good for such a low price! Customer service is perfect, too - you cannot go wrong with buyakilt.com. My dad is over the moon with his kilt - and so am I.
Fast reply by email Delivery as expected. Would maybe subtract 0.5 star due to relatively high delivery cost (to Netherlands). Despite this still best price I could find for the total deal. Since an adapter-plug was included unexpectedly 5 stars deserved
i ordered more than a week ago and have not received my order despite promisses of the site
Trustpilot has a banner that websites can display. This banner appears to show only above-average reviews. It does show the average score, to put things in perspective, but it would be more honest if the latest reviews, or reviews with the average score were displayed.
I had a very good expierience booking with Easybook.com It was quick, easy and the best price out there! The whole evening i was searching to book a trip to Venice with my girlfriend because i will ask her to marry me in Venice :) I stopped at Easybook and i noticed how easy it was to book! And the best price compared to many others! Truely the best! I will book again on Easytobook.com!
Het artikel is conform de omschrijving : what you see is what you get!
I placed three orders on Beauty Bay... one shipped with international saver and two with international express delivery. All three orders arrived within the described timeframe (2 business days for express and 10 business days for saver). I won't be using the saver option anymore, because 10 business days without any tracking is a loooong and uncomfortable wait, and the express delivery and tracking is more up my alley. The items were well wrapped, and samples were included with the premier service. So all in all I would recommend this company, but I would also recommend opting for the express delivery... if you order enough products, it's free anyway. And you can never have too much nail polish.
Without notice and without care, removing thousands of loyal customers over a long stretch of time with one stroke. Shame on you, Amazon.
My experience with flashcard for ds is that it is difficult to get them working on the ds with the right software etc. flashcard.es gives very clear information on the site, as well as for choosing the right card as for downloading the right software quick delivery without any problems makes them good quality company
snelle levering en duidelijk info over de status van de bestelling.
op internet zag ie er leuk uit maar toen ik hem in het echt zag was een grote lap stof.
we ordered three kamikaze outfits for a house party, we were worried about the shipping time to the netherlands, but the package arrived much sooner than the promised date. the suits are of good quality and also look great
Boohoo has a nice look & feel, the website is pretty solid and the products are trendy. Shipment is fast and reliable. Video's of products are awesome. Points: Sizing charts are kind of messy and don't apply for all products. IE Trousers are not listed. I think more detail on each product like on yesstyle.com product details (long page of model/fabric photos for each product) would be a good way to convince buyers. IE i did not purchase a jacket cuase I could not get a good idea of the fit/fabric.
We did buy tickets from Big Bus London tours in Holland by internet. It was not easy to find the first hop on stops, cause we did not know how the underground worked and where the first stop for the internet tickets was. Bought also tickets for the London eye for entering the bus, what really was conveniënt, we passed the long cues this way in no time. The guiding comments on the bus were up to date, as well the told ones one the red line as the taperecorded ones on the bleu and green line. The green line was not nice. We first had to wait for 30 minutes to catch this bus and then had a stop during the ride of 20 minutes. Wasted time while we could have seen another part instead during that time. Sometimes the lines ended on other places then what was told or got another route. Not so good cause we planned to see some things that we missed during our stay , cause of this. But in comparence with driving yourself it is a handy way to see a lot and hear a lot of London. The weather was very good so we had a great vieuw from the front of the bus on the city.
The ham was very tastefull and delicious. I share it with friends and neigbours, they all enjoy it very much,,
The ordering, billing and delivery were as promissed. The updates on delivery were amazing, I was very surprised by the creative storytelling.
Everything went very smooth. Even shipping to Europe was faster than I expected (cost a fair bit though). Items were packaged securely.
They have an amazing costumer service department (also at twitter!). The free shipping is really great too, refunding after I send a part back went also very quick!!
Very fast shipment to the Netherlands and the clothes are lovely! Will definately buy again at boohoo.com
Binnen een dag had ik de HDMI kabel in huis en het was de juiste. Ga zo door.
My order was delivered 2 days after I ordered and my card readers are exactly as described, perfect!
after my second purchase at fietspunt I sincerely recommend this shop, very good service, best value for money, indeed a real positive experience. See you next time.
your service was fast and a very helpful helpfill custoumer service
I rated 5 stars because on my experience, trusted site and fastest service ever. Keep it up !
Had some problems witha key i bought,the answer i got was,yeah i got that problem aswell. So i mentioned that maybe they should change the description on their site,as anyone buying it after me would run into the same activation problems. They did not. In the end i found a way to make it work myself. A solution that i sent them aswell. Thank you and better service would have been nice. As there are many cdkey sellers,with approx the same price,go ahead,and look for another.
I know some people still figure this is to good to be true,there must be a catch. well..there isn't ;) got my key within 5 mins and loving my game[Saint's row 3] Questions got answered quickly in chat and i'm def coming back here next time i want to buy a game! Why pay steam prices when you got this site? Charlie,Amsterdam.
Tot nu toe perfect maar is nog maar de 1ste keer.
het is gewoon een goede site en ik ben erg tevreden.
Sometimes I just don't care where I go. I want to use a good 5 star hotel with sauna, in either forest or perhaps close to the beach. I do need a bigger search radius on booking.com. 100km is just to small. Make it 500km. If we get to much results from the database, just show the first 100 hotels. I will add more filters myself! It must be possible to make this!
De stylus pen die ik gekocht heb werkt prima en de service was prima
The variety of clothes is awesome and very fashionable. Furthermore my order was processed really quick and recieved the parcel even before the minimum of five days that is stated for international delivery. Best online shop I have seen this far and would definitely order again.
They were fast en prompt, with sending the remote’s controls, the day after ordering they were already delivered.
Fast delivery as on previous occasions. Wrong size plectrum holder was sent out by accident. Aftersales responded quickly and swap for right size was handled efficiently and without extra postage costs.
I havent received my order yet.  Received a e-mail where I was told that my order had been dispatched. That e-mail was send to me on January 29 and after 10  working days still nothing...Starting to worry....
Systems4You responds promptly to emails, orders are shipped very quick and in a sturdy package preventing damage to the goods. I would surely recommend that you check this shop if you need automation and/or security products.. Two thumbs up, thanks Grzegorz. /Rene
Bought myself a new battery for my camera and had some questions about shipping...what a good service! I really recommend!!!
Svetila offers good quality light bulbs at great prices. They have a huge assortment, so special light bulbs can also be ordered. Nothing to complain about there website and pay options. Even with standard delivery i've recieved my orders within a week.
you can compose your own collection in tests, to fit your personal needs (eg. only fertility-test, combination fertility-pregnancytests etc), easy payment with PayPall and fast delivery, also to mainland Europe
service is perfect  quality is perfect always in the right time of the season sent
Most of the times when I order something in the UK,it's taking too long before it arrives at my address..... not with Speed Graphic Mail Order! They do it within a few working days! Thanks Jan
ik ben erg tevreden over de site en levering van Kixx
While the software does what it advertises, I was drawn to it due to the online uploader: I wanted to be able to upload and edit my albums from everywhere. Unfortunately, this online uploader is only available if you make use of JA's hosting. If you use your own, you have to use their software or use FTP. So, complete waste of money for me. Edit: added two stars because of actual quick response to this review (see below), which is good service. And in the end it's my own fault for not researching properly :)
As a regular customer of play.com I can say that I'm very enthusiastic about this company. They have very competitive prices and usually deliver within 2 weeks (I live in the Netherlands). No shipping costs is also one of the goodies this company has to offer. Have had one copy of a game that never arrived, I contacted play.com about this and they sent another copy right away. Great service! I recommend this company to everyone that doesn't mind a little wait if you're in an other country. Kind regards, Ronald Poldervaart
I tried the sample I received the next day. After I shaved I applied GladSkin as any other aftershave. Gonna be honest... it kinda felt like putting on hair gel on your face, but after a minute that feeling was all gone. And I was actually surprised that it really worked! No redness or irritated skin... nothing! So I highly recommend using GladSkin to every guy (or women for that matter) that has got shaving irritations, because it just works!
het gaat zo simpel ook al ben ik 60, even via internet en dan hup op je mobiel.
No problem at all, delivery almost fast, and all as stated on the shop, so nothing to, good job !
Very good at ordering, and product also very good but delivery took a week...
In May 2013 I ordered a chair and bench on infurn ( AU - 243763 ) . These would be delivered ( September). Between 10-18 weeks That did not happen. After call I got a lame excuse that the order was delayed . Later it was the quality check that the shipment was in the way , and now it is supposedly difficult Chinese customs . For one of the items , the scheduled delivery in April. The other down for February. I called back but there is NO service offered . Order not here. I am preparing legal action to tackle because now not be responded to. My mail this scam to After I 've expressed my dissatisfaction ( substantiated ) here and in other places I have spoken extensively with multiple Infurn employees. In a constructive way , so it seemed. However, both orders were postponed again . One with a big month , the other two months . Then agreed that both orders were canceled on condition full refund of my purchase price . I was done with it . Now, after more than a month ( promise was made ​​within 30 days of cancellation ) not received anything . Give the help desk staff to pass with urgency, a scheduled phone appointment via the website on March 3, is not fulfilled . I am not called. It is a pity that there is no lower rating than 1 star . That would be better suited to this terrible club . I can only say that I recommend everyone NOT to order. At this club And I order many years in dozens of different parties online throughout the world . But never experienced anything alike this ..
When visiting the Fjällräven outlet store in Sweden I fell in love with the No. 21 Backpack but the price stopped me from buying it. Back home I discovered this website, the nice prices and ordered the bag (and a No.1 for my boyfriend). We are really happy with the backpacks. Really good (Swedish) quality and I love the little fox on it :)
I have used autoeurope multiple times and the service is always a pleasure so good pricing and service can be delivered for car rental
FC-Moto has great products good quality and quick delivery. Communication good be a bit better.
The one company I always return to for equipment, beans, advice etc. Where knowledge, efficiency and good service go hand in hand in order to serve the customer.
Apart from one mistake they made (delivery guy just left the flowers at the door while receiver wasn't home) I have use this service often without any problems.
Goede service ! Deze is site is het waard om in de favorites te bewaren.
There where some problems to deliver at my hotel. The hotel whas not informed about our reservation or they had a wrong reservation name from the travel agency. The custmer service off Orlando atractions did every thing to solve this problem so they can deliver at the hotel. Many phone calls they have made and keep me informed over the email. Many thanks to Norma from Orlando Atractions. Everthing was solved and i will make them a big compliment. Thanks Orlando atractions! Greetings Kim Noord from Holland
I ordered a Canon EOS 60D. I had to send a copy of my ID and proof of residence, (illegal due to privacy, but I did it anyway). My order #5032557 is pending due to "dispute". Oh no, no dispute at all, I just want my camera te be shipped as soon as possible. I contacted PayPal and they recommended me to negotiate with these people through their system. which I did. But I do not even get response of these people through the PayPal system. I am pretty sure I just lost € 469,19. I will put these unreliable people on my website and blog, so that everyone can see you better to not business with this firm !!!!
Very nice site to find your replacement car bulbs, easy to navigate and wth a great description of the available bulbs. Bulbs ordered neatly packed, reasonable in price and delivered very fast
I have bought several times Honda parts at CMS and it is a fantastic company. They have lots of parts that  Honda can not deliver anymore. (from 50cc to 1100cc and more) Oem and aftermarket. Quality of  aftermarket parts is great, like OEM parts. Also their service and communication is great and they will do their best for you if you have any problem. I would recommend CMS to anyone who have Japanese oldtimers and I will buy again from them!!
I needed very fast money for xboxone and with pc game supply it was al arranged very quickly.
March 11th I ordered an battery charger, because they had the best price on the web. It took 4 days before "pending" changed in "dispatched". Usually it takes 2 to 3 days before an item arrives from the UK to the Netherlands. After a week I send them an e-mail as NEVER EVER Live Support is ON line, if they could give me a track & trace of some kind. No response. 4 days ago I send them an irritated e-mail that I was willing to wait one more week before contacting Pay Pal for a refund. Today, March 26d I finally received an enormous box full of styrofoam thingies and hidden in there, I found my charger, also packed very well. The delivery man told me it was actually dispatched March 24th! So I was waiting 13 days for nothing? Probably they did not have it in stock and it had to be ordered. But why not be honest and tell me? Why the silent treatment? I made a good deal but the customer service is extremely uncourteous! If friends will ask me, Should I order with Eurobatteries, I would tell them: ONLY WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN A HURRY! I hope my item never will break or in need of warranty.... :-(
Though the CDWOW website explicitly mentions that eveything is delivered free ("Alles altijd GRATIS BEZORGD" - the ad in Dutch), and though what I ordered wasn't a perfume (the Questions and Answers mention that rarely, but only for perfumes ("geurtje" in Dutch), custums costs have to be paid (but what I ordered wasn't a perfume) I had to pay € 17,06 on my order at the occasion of the delivery thus ending up with a much too high price (€ 31,99 + € 17,06)! I expect from CDWOW being refunded for this practice!
Just ordered. Had a bad experience with other Barbour dealer, so was expecting nothing. Got good en quick delivery of the product I wanted at a reasonable price
I already recommended this website foor great deals en good service
good service, and fast doorstep delivery. Getting parts shipped from Paddock if easier than driving to my nearest LR parts center, and better value for money. Negative is that every shipment is packed with a huge amount of recycled paper. Looks like Padddock spares is a cover up operation to export as much used paper as possible.
The site was clear and the shipment arrived at the expected date. I will certainly do business with iPodhoes again! Highly recommended!
I never had bad experiences with Hostelworld nor with the hostels I visited via Hostelworld. The reviews and judgments of my fellow travelers are to a high extend in line with my own experiences. For me there is no traveling without a prior visit to Hostelworld
Ik ben prima tevreden over de levering van de bestelde cartridges
i've received the key with instructions on how to download your purchased content, useful information! great job and a nice service.
waited more then an hour to get our car, because they all the customers before us complained, because the car they had booked was not available. when we finally got served, our booked astra was also not available. I agreed with a smaller car and a price reduction. The car (ford fiesta) was brand nwe and it all worked out fine. returning the car was very fast and convenient, drop off the keys very fast and easy!
I love Farfetch and the idea behind it: the possibility to shop at very niche stores all over Europe (and the USA if I would be willing to pay customs fee, which I am not) that do not have a webshop of their own. I have placed several orders at Farfetch and everything went well. For all those who complain about the short return period: yes, it is quite short if you compare with for example Zalando with their 100 days return period, but this is a totally different shop with completely other logistics and other target customers. The thing with online shopping is that you have to be willing to read the FAQ before buying and complaining. Farfetch is transparent in their terms and conditions. And by they way: the return period is not 5 days, but 10 days max. You need to book your return within 5 days after receiving your order, and after this you need to schedule a pickup within 5 days after you have booked your return. So 10 days max it is..
I quite like Yoox. Prices and handling of delivery and returns are okay, customer services is not so I just hope I that don't have to deal with them too often (replies are really slow and mostly inadequate, stupidity of employees is a frustration that I'm getting used to, unfortunately). BUT: recently Yoox changed the return conditions in terms of costs. I hate it when an online store does that without having the decency to inform (regular) customers that they have. (Which off course they do when something becomes cheaper and therefore will boost sales, but when it doesn't... oh well.. customers will find out that they have to pay for something that they didn't have to before when it is already too late anyway.)
Just before Christmas I ordered 2 golfbags for my sons. Unfortunately, the Titleist bag that I ordered was no longer in stock, but this can happen. I then gave a proper alternative, but got completely different bag delivered. I contact 118 and agreed to return the bag and explained what alternative my son wanted. Then on December 24, I returned the bag via registered post. I have received confirmation of delivery at the address of 118. However, as until today I have not received the alternative bag, neither a refund nor even a response on my numerous reminders. Phone is not answered, etc. I am completely fed up with this company and will never order again. Pls do all the same. This company stinks!
De info op de site was duidelijk, en de levering conform afspraak. Ik vond de levering van de rugzak door Travelbags dan ook een prima ervaring.
I ordered and payed an item not on stock. I tried tracking my order on line, but the delivery times made no sense. After a month I called to see what was happening. The item could not be delivered. I cancelled the order and provided my bank details for the refund. No refund after a few weeks, so I called again. My bank details were not complete, so I completed them. Queried about my  refund a few times, every time the answer was "refund after 30 days after your bank details are complete." After thirty days, no refund. It took a lot of emails and phone calls to finally get refunded. My principal worries: Expansys does not tell you what is happening (item can not be delivered, bank details not complete, ...) and expects its customers to be clairvoyant. Secondly, they violate their own 30-days refund policy. A log of all facts is available.
i like shopping with allsole as there is never a problem, they  dispatch the items very quick and you get what you ordered! i will certainly continue shopping at allsole!
The shop is ok but not complete enough. Hopefully this will change in the future. Furthermore there was a minor issue in the delivery with UPS. They received an incomplete address from ecco. So the delivery took some days extra.
i'm satisfied with german wings. low prices, good service. i would suggest to add paypal as payment method. i once forgot my little card-reader and if i want to book online with my creditcard i need it to put in a securitycode. i called the german wings custumer service and via the custumer service i did not need my card reader thank god. they were really helpful and i made a reservation within a few minutes. the only thing is it is not really cheap to call the custumer sevice. for 10 minutes you pay like 10 euro haha. and i called with a prepaid card i bought in the country i stayed in, so in the middle of the conversetion my call credit was gone. i quickly upgraded and called back and they imediatelly knew who i was and i just needed to confirm and it was done. really nice and professional. the custumer service people were really great soo thanks guys! and add paypal!
i love harrods! wonderful to be able to order even from another country. my only remark is pleasee put more brands online for us who are not every day in London but love fashion :))
i love asos. especially the brands. the offers and promotions are great. And off course u guys ship to the continental europe!!
it's too bad that you guys don't deliver anymore to holland. the german douglas shop is much better than the dutch. more to chose from. i'll hope you'll deliver to holland again because i love your products and your service is great!
wow what a fast delivery, and I live oversees! the only thing i think they should do is, for us who have to pay importtaxes in europe, is extract the us taxes.
The prices are very attractive for cute products. Delivery to Netherlands is free and proceeds rapidly. Only the return conditions aren't attractive for countries outside the UK.
The first shipment via MBeautylounge.com went perfectly. No problems at all, even within two weeks delivered to the Netherlands. With such a positive vibe, I decided to order with a few more people to share the expensive shipping costs, but unfortunately, this package took forever...and ever.. and ever... Emailed them every single day, tried to look for a phone number, nothing at-all. Got totally no response on any of my emails. Discussed with VISA to refund the amount, and apparantely this worked, as we got the package within 2 weeks since then. Do not ask how the package looked like.. eitherway, we will never ever order with them anymore.
I did an order from the Netherlands on friday evening, and I received in on tuesday! So it was really quick, an order from a dutch company would have taken even so long. I bought a onesie and a jeans. Took one size bigger and they were both perfect! Love my onesie!
Thank you Euroflorist, for a fast, efficient and professional service. Through your easy-to-use website we were able to choose the flowers we wanted and have them delivered speedily to our relative in the Netherlands. The flowers were lovely - beautifully fresh amd very much appreciated!
I bought a game and almost instantly received a Steam Gift link. You can use the gift for yourself or even give it to a friend! Paying with PayPal was super easy as well. Just a few mouse clicks and you're done, no need to register with any other private information.
I bought the Ray-Ban 3025 Aviator Gunmetal W3236 at Sunglassesshop.com . Because all glasses that are 55mm are mentioned on the website, I expected that this glasses were 58 mm (which is the medium size), because there ain't a size mentioned on the website. The sunglasses were delivered in 3 days in the Netherlands, which is a pretty fast service. Unfortunately, I got the glasses in 55 mm, which I couldn't know. I mailed the customer service, but I didn't got a reaction. The chat service said that I had to send it back on my own costs, which is rediculous, because I couldn't know the size and it isn't mentioned clearly on the website. The returning costs + the mail that wasn't responded made me a unsatisfied customer.
After several orders with this company, I am still astonished at their delivery speed and great service. I would recommend them without hesitation.
i order, it's confirmed, i paid, and it was settled, so everything goes smoothly
Dont rent from this company. They completely screwed us over for our wedding day. We reserved a Porsche Cayenne for our wedding. We get to the counter with ALL documents they ask for and they say, 'no, you can't take the car'. You need a passport, we had local government issued ID cards as per Hertz own request via email "RENTER MUST SHOW PASSPORT OR ID CARD". We had 2 driving licenses with us, 2 ID cards and 2 credit cards as we were asked to do. We then said, ok no problem we go home to get passports as it was only 15 minutes. The woman behind the counter says sorry we now cancel your booking because it will be late. We explained again that it is for wedding and they say "ok, you can have a small car, no problem, the Porsche is special". Ok, seems to us that every time we had an answer this woman invented a new reason not to give us a car. We ask why our ID cards are ok for small car but not for the car we ordered and had bought all the info, cards, etc for. We can only assume this arrogant middle class woman behind the counter either was discriminating against us because of our nationalities or because of the fact that she thought we were not good enough to have a Porsche on our wedding. Which is kind of ironic as the Bentley rental people were very nice to us. Joke is ultimately on Hertz as we take our money elsewhere.
This Canon approved repair company tried to cheat us out of 500 euros. We sent our camera in for repair, we were told it needed a complete new power supply, mainboard and a few other things. Of course the camera was not worth repairing. We sent it to another small local company (not Canon approved) where the camera was repaired for under 50 euro! Of course you want to make money but over charging people by lying to them is illegal. From 50eur to 500eur is quite a large amount of money. To cap things off, their customer services staff were very short (almost rude) during our entire correspondence. Do not trust these people.
I ordered a jacket for my daughter (€85). After 3 weeks I had received nothing, so I registered a complaint online. It was quickly answered - they had no idea what had gone wrong but the jacket was now sold out, would I like to order something else? My money was now in an Otto "account". I tried to pay for a different jacket on the website, but I could only use the account if I wanted to pay in installments, so I rang the klantenservice (expensive from my mobile!). They were helpful and arranged to make one payment and refund me the change. The jacket arrived with a large tear in the shoulder and had to be returned. This was just before Christmas, so Otto have had my money since October and I am still waiting for my cash to be returned (only €79 as I am still being charged for postage!). I will never use this company again.
Ordered from overseas on January 2nd - beautiful bouquet was with my mum 2 hours later. I was informed by email when they had arrived. My Mum was delighted with the quality. Can't ask for more.
ArgusCarHire is a very good site to get the best price in the market after 6 Years of experience with them !
I think FB must be the worst loyalty program ever. For years I have been trying to use our Miles to book flights for my family but there is NEVER availablitiy during school holidays. Also, I can't get an Award upgrade unless I purchase a more expensive ticket. I recently finally found some availability but had to pay 90.000 Miles for three one way flights from Geneva to Amsterdam. They call this "Flex" awards but it should be called "we don't want to offer Awards on flights for the advertised 10.000 Miles so we will charge you 3x as many Miles to discourage you from buying Award tickets." In addition, direct flights operated by KLM are discouraged by charging more Miles so people take two flights which has a more negative impact on the environment. Finally, I have sent written complaints to their "Customer Services" which have not been answered.
Because of the unflexible T&C of their loyalty program, we now have two loyalty card numbers with 2 points balances and are unable to combine them - even though every booking was made in my husbands name. Crap service.
Delivery was as promised within 5 days. Only thing missing was the info on how to install the materials. Maybe this info is not standard, but would have helped a lot. Especially if you know that the ordered items are matching items and need to be installed together.
I used WIMDU to travel to Berlin last New Years and we had a perfect apartment in a nice neighborhood! Travelling is much cheaper this way and way more comfortable and special. Not giving it 5 stars (yet!) because sometimes the website isn't functioning the way it should (think: can not define neigborhoods, places outside the city I am looking are also in the search results). Definitely will book through WIMDU again :-)
I ordered an Andoïd phone, got it and am very satisfied.
Ordered 2 items and 1 arrived quickly, while the other one still hasn't arrived after 2 weeks. Also no sign from Pet Supermarket what is happening. Tried to use the online chat on their web site, but again, no reply. Have now sent them an email and guess what: received an automatic reply with a case number. Still don't know if and when the item is going to be delivered. Poor customer services!
Easy to find details and book the insurance you need
Andrea provided me with detailed tracking data which the website could not find. Well done Andrea and many thanks!!! Herbie @ COMCENSUS LTD
It's a great site, which is delivering their products very fast.
I placed my order and two days later I recieved it. It works perfectly
We booked a jazznight with diner at l'Etoile. It was excellent, we've had a delicious diner beautiful plates they looked like paintings, with beautifull wine  and a wonderfull jazz/blues afterparty. It was an all inclusive booking, most of the time it's not my charme, but this was excellent.  Club l'Etoile is a very beautifull place with nice and kind people to help and serve you.
The new hoop have arrived today, meaning that it will be a great tv night for the hubbie. I will be embroidering tonight........ All items are in tip top condition so I am a happy customer. Thanks for the service Kathleen
I ordered one week ago and did not get any status update untill now. Status is still 'processing' !!!! I am very disappointed now in Axminster.
Their website contains all information that is needed to purchase and sell precious metals. Orders are processed very swiftly and without confusion. BullionVault offers a service that is difficult to beat!
I ordered the bike on Friday evening from the Netherlands and payed with Paypal. All actions were communicated to me by e-mail. Tuesday the bike was delivered bij UPS. No shipping costs from Germany. The bike is in perfect condition and adjusted. I only had to mount the paddles. I reseved my bike over €150,- cheaper then all webshops in the Netherlands!
Ordered a card, but this was never send. Seen the reviews after, and it looks like I am not the only one.
I ordered a product that was out of stock and I expected a 3 week waiting t ime, but instead I received the packet within 2 days!!
The company seems to be pretty new to the international market because it took longer to send the package and to receive the payment. This took a couple of emails but the people at the company were very eager to help me out. They actually stated that they do not get a lot of international customers and therefore it is not a problem to me at all that it took two emails to make sure the product was shipped. The shipping took it's time but that was due to Royal mail and not due to the company so no problems there either. The price is right and I really love the leather journal. I will definitely order more at this shop.
De bestelling op de site is eenvoudig te plaatsen, en de levering is conform de beloftes.
Me and my sister have travelled several times to Africa but our trip to Tanzania and Botswana organized by Africa Odyssey was one of the moste wonderful trips we had. Everything was well organized  and above our expectations. In Tanzania we have been to selous and ruaha and greystoke mahale. In Botswana we have been to chitabe lediba, duba plains and savuti. Everything was exactly what was told and we were very well informed about everything. Therefore we can recommend Africa Odyssey as the best to travel in Africa.
Dont play this game it dont worth your money/time. Admins only screw ther players. Bugs everywhere and if u report 1 they dont care and doing nothing. they prefer to make more bugs then make the bugs that are still in the game. you can spend all your money inthere but u dont get any service, they will lauch when u die by a bug. so u can start over and pay more to them.
Ben erg tevreden over de site, de levering en het produkt.
Looking for a new drysuit, we found CoastWatersports and is was the best price. We had some trouble to figure out the right size, but by telephone Dave could help us out. It fits perfect, and the drysuit is very nice. We ordered the rest there as well, and it is all good quality. Though it's international postage, it came fast, and only for little extra. It was very well packed, so everything is ok. You can pay by all means, Visa, paypal, internet etc. For the best exchange rate, visa is advisable. Not everything was in stock, but most of it was. Nice shop, we will get our sailingstuuf for our boys here in the future.
bought 4 maxi skirts, they are great! fast delivery to Holland
this is a reliable seller of numerous smells. Prices are fair and postage does not take long.
Good site. Cheap but some products can be low quality. Always look at the product review before buying anything. And be willing to wait a long time
I've ordered a lot here, it's cheap but a lot of times it takes months to get here. But they keep contact
The products I had ordered from this website, were delivered with damage. One of the two can's was broken, as a result that all of the content (powder) was everywhere but where it's suppose to be. Completely useless as you can imagine. After trying to contact the company, it took almost a week when someone replied every time I mailed them. It took me one month (!) before they came with a solution, which was 7,50 Pounds over a can that costed approximately 40 Pounds. I tolt them I would not agree to that, and I haven't heard from them since. It's a shame
They have excellent offers and it's very easy to order. Deliveries abroad might take a while but at these prices I am willing to wait a bit.
ben zeer content van de reactie van de mails die ik steeds heb gekregen
ik kan er weer een half jaartje mee door nu
After ordering the software, they were very quick to reply and send me the link for the download. Everything went very smooth and the software works great!!
Nice items, nice prices and quick international delivery! Return costs are pretty high from Holland back to UK, but I received my money back within a week.
One star as this is the lowest I could give. Ordered, paid, received the wrong product. My communications for return and refund are not answered. These guys are not to be trusted! Beware not to buy anything here!!
I paid using Hipay to order with what turned out to be a fraudulent webshop. My request to cancel and refund my payment was denied almost immediately. Speak of not willing to help.... What a difference from the likes of Paypal. Don't use these guys if you can pay with a credible payment service. In fact, don't buy with sites that only offer these guys....
It has been a pleasure to work with Holland Tour Guides;  they are very professional, flexible and helpful. They did everything they could to make the tour perfect. Excellent service all round from start to finish! I recommend them 100%! Holland Tour Guides thank you!
Came over to the UK, it was very important that everything was 100% correct and it was the case. Perfect!
good site with beautifull shoes and a very good service to take the shoes to your own home to wear them
I ordered Oakley M-frame replacement glasses, that were not in stock. I did it through my native language shop (dutch). Unfortunately the Dutch speaking sales rep was away, but when i replied to the out-of-office another person helped me order and applied a discount. A bit later than expected the glasses arrived in good order. All in all: recommended. I would use them again, surely!
Het is echt super snel, de bestelling is er na 1 dag
Bestelling lag na 1 dag al in de bus. Zeer vlotte en correcte service dus.
I rent a car for 3 days in Bordeaux. It was cheap and the car was brand new. Highly recommended
Their web site shows items in stock while they are not. They take your payment and after 5 days you get a message that item is not in stock. I ordered a more expensive radio and got the same out of stock message one day later !!! When I threatened to cancel my order suddenly the item was in stock and would be shipped the next day. Since that time I have contacted dx.com 3 times to ask for the status of the shipment. They say: wait a few more days. After 20 days I am still waiting for the shipment to arrive. Over the past 15 years I never had to wait this long for a product to arrive. The last chat was ended abruptly by their help desk person after I said that I would request a refund if the order does not arrive before end of April.
Prioritypass is an excellent travel companion. However a bit expensive if you don`t have it included in your credit card, still worth it though. Ordering process is easy. The card arrived withhin 2-3 weeks. Negative is that there are not many lounges in the scandic region available.
Pgs is a good low cost carrier. The booking engine is good. Emergency seats can be booked in advance for a low fee. Other seats are standard low cost airline seat. Be aware that  the transfer desk at sabiha gökcen airport is a joke. Waiting time is arround 1-2 hours. So book only a flight only with a transfer time over there of at least 3 hours.
This is probably the best charity in the world since they put a lot of effort in it, it is very transparent and all the money donated goes directly to the projects. The overhead is paid for by sponsorship. They send you very detailed information about the projects. All comunication is through mail (no expensive postage costs s well).
I tried to verify my credit card. The charged 4.85 Swiss Francs to my credit card for the verification. I entered this amount later in the verification process and it failed, incorrect amount. Should rather say our system is incorrect. Later I got a standard replay...since verification failed on your side....(Me screaming at the computer: Damn it, IT FAILED ON YOUR FREEKING SIDE!) I scaned & sent them all the documents they requested afterwards. Stil no verification. Luckily the 4.85 Swiss Francs were credited to my account and I could donate them to Hope agency in Cambodia which accepts skrill donations. Never thought that a simple registration of a credit card could cause so much trouble and I wish as welI that I never registred with this unbeleavable company. I removed my credit card data. I wouldn`t trust them as far as I can throw them. Its so sad. Another company that does not value their customers at all. Maybe EA will get finally a competitor on par for the Consumer`s worst company of the year bracket. Not using it and never will. Thank good for paypal with its high fees and a desent customer service. And a tip to moneybookers, now skrill and tomorrow mayb bkritt. You don`t have to change your company name if you keep treating your customers like that. In the long run the only difference that is going to make is the name that will be written on the bankruptcy notice.
Everything is perfect, delivery was in the Netherlands, it was fast and correct! it is faster when i order something in the Netherlands. thank you
i really enjoyed it. One point of critic is that Moma and the Cloisters were on one account. its almost not doable to do them both in one day.
No problems according to the purchase and depriverende of THE product.
Fast and efficient quote received through Money supermarket, easily transferred to Hastings Direct site and completing the purchase was simplicity itself. No digging around for NCD proof as this appears to have all been retrieved from on-line data sources. So far, all is good.  I have no comment to make re their claims efficiency, and I hope I never need to have that knowledge.
I think ecco shop is overall a nice shop. However,  I would like to improve is the delivery time and options. I think the delivery time is too long for a webshop in this day and age + I  think the customer should at least have the option to choose a faster delivery option (with extra cost perhaps). What would also be nice is if the customer could choose a preferred delivery date. I ordered a pair of shoes for work and I know I won't be at home when they are delivered, it's very annoying that I can't change that.
one behind this thinking is really such a genius one deserves some awards
Although i'm from Holland i prefer to buy from Hanon, because they stock more heat and more models then most stores over here and they also stock most hard-to-get releases online. Also because of their low shipping prices they can compete with the prices over here and on many occasions are less expensive even with shipping included! Their delivery is on point and always reliable, which is not always the case with other UK parcel-services. So far I've been buying from here for the past 3-4 years and keep returning.
The clothes of boohoo are really nice and not expensive . The delevery is fast.
Even for me is was easy to make a booking for our trip to the UK It would be even more easy  when I had the possebility for making this excersition in my own language.
I'm happy with the service but not sure what the additional cost was for.
I was looking for the best price car rental option in South-East Australia. It looked like ACE was the one with the lowest price, though with the disadvantage that their pickup location is off-airport. As I work in the travel industry most travel companies give special discount to colleagues. ACE offered me a 25% discount and asked me to mail my booking reference so they can deduct the discount afterwards. And so I did. ACE did not respond to my forwarded booking reference. I re-sent my booking reference and then they told me I already booked with an 20% coupon code. When I asked them to just deduct the 5% difference, they just choose to not respond anymore. As the first confirmation mail stated "You will receive an email confirmation from the renting location shortly. Until that time, please DO NOT regard this booking as confirmed." I was still waiting for my final booking confirmation. After a week of waiting I noticed this mail landed in my Gmail Spam box. As I probably am not the only one using Gmail, I notified ACE. They never responded. As my trip itinerary changed, I had to cancel my booking. So I contacted ACE web chat. They told me they were not able to help me as they could only see New Zealand bookings. They asked me to send an email with my request. As you might guess, they did not respond. I had to send them a second mail to ask to cancel my booking before cancellation got confirmed. I made a new booking with ACE, this time a one-way Adelaide to Sydney rental. Again I had to wait for confirmation and had to send an email to ACE to request to either confirm or cancel. Just a few days before I was flying to Adelaide - I got my confirmation. All settled! When I arrived at the airport I had to call ACE to get me picked up. When I called the general ACE 1-800 number and choose the option to be picked up at Adelaide Airport, I got an woman telling me I had called the wrong number. I then called their local 1-800 number and I was picked up within 15 minutes. The drive to their location took almost half an hour. Once arrived at the location they tried to sell me their Collision Damage Waiver Option, an insurance which charges you $19 a day so you will not have a pay a liability of $3,000 in case of an accident. As I was renting for 14 days, that would equal $266 which I found to much and was the reason I decided not to do so at time of booking. Of course they tried to convince me that there is a probability to hit a kangaroo etc. Because I did not want this insurance, they wanted to put a hold on my creditcard of $3,000. That was impossible as my creditcard has a limit of $2,000. After a lot of hassle they offered me the insurance at $170. As I had no other choice, I decided to take the offer. On the day of arrival I had to drive 6 hours to my first destination. Unfortunately I noticed that the car was not well aligned. On a flat even road it would go left without touching the steering wheel. It was really tiring to drive the car so I sent an email to them to ask if it would be okay to bring back the car in two days to their Melbourne location. I asked for a confirmation. I never received any reply. As I would not know if they could either fix or replace the car, I decided to take my loss and not to waste my time and kept the car. The day before I had to bring my car back to their city location in Sydney, they called me to tell me that I had to bring the car back before 4pm. Though I rented the car (with a reason) until 5:30pm and that time was in my contract. They told me that was a mistake and I really should bring it back before 4pm as the location closes at 4pm. If I wanted to do it later, I could bring it back to their airport location. I then asked who would pay my taxi to the city and they told me I would have to. Of course I did not accept this; their mistake it not my problem. At the end they offered me to reimburse the transportation costs. At the end I changed my plans due to bad weather and I was able to bring the car back to their city location before 4pm. The rental contract said 'Cnr William and Riley Street Darlinghurst Sydney'. When going there I could not find any ACE sign at all. I saw Thrifty, Alamo, Budget, Hertz etc. though no ACE. I then walked in at Hertz to ask if they knew where to find ACE. Then they told me they handle ACE returns. I mean HELLO!! why doesn't ACE just tell their customers to look for Hertz instead of letting customers find out their selves. All and all a long story. I think ACE could do a lot more to professionalize their service. I am unhappy with the (lack of) service I received. For me this was the first and last time I booked a car at ACE.
in al die jaren dat ik lid ben verloopt het prima
Promises and more promises and more promises and . . . And in the meanwhile I am waiting for 1 year, 6 months, 2 weeks and 1 day. I do not trust this 'firm' for one bit. They promised a refund which should have happened between 15 and 21 July. NOTHING Am I surprised? Oh no. This 'firm' does not surprise me. Not anymore. Look at these complaints. They all say the same. Do not buy anything from this 'firm'. Once they have your money they are satisfied, and the customer? Well I feel really stupid for not checking these complaints before I placed my order. A classic trap. And I fell in to it. I work really really hard for every Euro and they treated me really the wrong way. So now I wonder if this complaint will be removed like a lot of other complaints on this website. Because this came from  a very angry customer. Or will they call me? Will they finally pay me my money back like they promised me a month ago? I don't think so. So wannabe customer, be wise and do not throw away your money! --------------------------- Finally, I díd get my money back. Something I honestly did not expect at all! As a reaction on this complaint through trustpilot I did receive 2 phonecalls from a lady named Valery of customer services. This  lady  managed to turn this ordeal around. Today I checked my bank account and, to my big surprise there it was. Finally someone took my complaint seriously. All my actions towards the Dutch department did not result in any action. Very annoying. So I am happy this turned out this way. I hope any customer with similar complaints will get the same treatment and result I got. Trustpilot thank you for this opportunity and your strength in rating shops
One of the things I mostly like about CMS is that you can get new parts of older motorcycles.
It's nice to stay in other places than the normal hotel, more value for your money, different places. We used House Trip for the first time, and we think we'll use it more often
It is a pleasure to book with WImdu: it is easy, a lot of nice possibilities, relatively cheap and really nice hosts! Just try it.
Watch out, this site is unreliable. They don't send out your order after you make a payment.
Due to shipping the keys manually instead of an automated system my key took 12 hours to arrive. Good support and a good shop, just a tat slow in some cases
I normally don't review companies, but I've seen many bad reviews on sites about Go2Arena that I have to make it up for them. I ordered several games here and I've always got a working key within 30 seconds of completing my payment. There was a single time my key was for the wrong game when I tried to activate it on Steam. I contacted support and withint 4 hours I had a working key for the game I offered. That's still quicker then driving back to the store with your game and receipt and try to explain what went wrong. This company does great business and offers great service. Yes things can go wrong as people make mistakes but they do their greatest to make up for it.
Prima en levering op de dag die ik had  gevraagd.
I like the products. The time that needs to deliver the products in the Netherlands is rather long. In that way it occured that I didn't have enough between two orders.
Fast delivery, and a lot of knowledge about the productschap they sell. I would recommend this to everyone!!
best service within 3 days I received my iPad .
Take sometime and you will find à large number of best Hostel wich can easely compeed with 4 stars hotels! Only they are much more Cheap and You find a lot of travelling friends! Just do it, it's easy on the website from hostelworld.com!
So far my experience with batronix is very good. I hope it stays good, also when I might have some trouble
Thanks for the fast processing and i truly got what i was expecting! :)
I found this site on internet, after i searched thru jetcost.nl. and they offerd the best ticketprice. I was surprised that the difference was so much. Im a happy costumer atm. So next time i know where to book my flights. Keep up the good work.
I ordered some items that my daughter wanted.  They arrived in The Netherlands quickly and seemed to be of good quality and just what she wanted.  I did have to return a pair of jeans that was too small, but this was received and handled right away.
The order was very soon at my adress good wrapped en good service.
I found this website when looking for new judo mats. Initial price on the website was low but unfortunately incorrect, but they made me a very good offer. Prices have been updated and are still very competitve. I placed the order and within three weeks (mats had yet to be produced) the mats were delivered. The delivery address was at my home, but as the gym is nearby the delivery guy had no problem to deliver the mats there! All in all very good service for good price.
Buy at Wiggle because it's cheap. Delivery is free most of the times, returning however not always. If you choose for free delivery it will take some time to get at your home (this is the case if you live in the Netherlands).
I am over my fifties now. Five years ago I discovered the Goliath shoes. My first pair became a second skin to me. I do not have difficult feet, but these shoes are really what you can call: Feetwalkers.
My wife and I had a great time in a nice apartment more than large enough for us. The apartment was situated in a calm street near all facilities one needs. Parking our car was very comfortable. Our host was very helpful and friendly.
Dear PC Specialist, I can't begin to tell you how amazed I am at discovering a PC equipment store that offers top range customizable equipment with very reasonable prices and tops it with customer service of a level I haven't found in any internet store period! I'm now the happy owner of a dead silent, super fast and great looking laptop, for the same price I'd have paid for a run-off-the-mill laptop with inferior components at a regular supplier. And that's including shipping costs and great tracking info from the UK to the Netherlands! I need not look any further if I ever need anything you're offering that's for sure, and I'll be sure to tell the same to anyone who wants to hear it :)
But I do not see why I should write a review after giving my rating ..
het is een perfect provider en ik ben zeker zijn vasteklant.
I ordered a Adidas tracksuit and a shirt. One on sale (always nice) and a nice tri-colored shirt. I know Adidas to have good quality, prices where fair. But I bought here for the variety they have. The Adidas shirt wasn't even for sale in the official Adidas web-shop! Delivery was fast so no complaints there. All in all was my first order here a good experience.
I especially like free and very nice packaging. Really easy to make good gifts. Please keep it up and keep good selection of Djeco sets.
I bought a box of Lego Star Wars and found out a piece was missing. Sadly, I didn't have that piece as a spare (it was quite special), so I went to the Lego website, where I found a form where you could write down if you were missing a piece. I did this on Friday evening and got the missing piece in my mailbox yesterday! Without cost :D Now, THAT's service!
I bought a pair of shoes here, model 574 in grey/pink. Everything seemed legit, until I saw that the money had been sent to China. That's when I started to check out the website and found out that it is indeed located in China. This directly rang some alarm bells with me, but I was just hoping for the best. Of course it went wrong anyway and I got the right model, but in the wrong colors. After contacting the customer service (if you can call it a service at least, they are very rude), they told me that they were very sorry about the color, but the ones I ordered were not in stock. Seriously, what self-respecting company does this?! A normal company would have contacted me and told me that they didn't have it in stock, but I could wait for it. Or they would have offered to cancel the order. No, Newbalancesneakers.dk just sends you different shoes. Shoes are shoes, right? The customer service offered me a discount for when I purchase with them next time, but no person in it's right mind would purchase here again in the future after something goes wrong like this. I asked for my money back or the right shoes, but the answer was (and this is a direct copy of the COMPLETE email!) "we had said , this pair of shoes are out of stock, so we can not delivery for you again, thanks." No reaction whatsoever on my question about getting my money back. I contacted my bank, because I purchased them with my Dankort (a Danish credit card), and they opened a dispute about this. All I needed to do was ask for a returnaddress. If they won't give it, I will get my money back through the bank (forced return). If they do, I have to return the products and then the company has to give me my money back. I will of course not pay the costs for the return. I am going to do everything within my power to bring this company down. It looks like they randomly pick shoes off the shelves and send them. They just try to scam us.

I bought a Nintendo 3DS in Holland, but when I got home I noticed the outer cameras weren't working properly. I contacted the shop in Holland first, but they couldn't do anything for me, so I contacted Bergsala. They told me to send the 3DS with a description of the problem and they would look at it. Sadly, he couldn't fix it in Denmark, so he had to send my 3DS to Sweden. Today, 7 WORK days after I sent it, I received it home again. I can see it's a completely new device, but it still had all my data! Even though Nintendo does not have their own office in Denmark and/or Scandinavia, they chose a very capable company to do all the repairs for them. Great work! One note (that doesn't influence the score): The DPD delivery guy just put the package in front of my door and rang the bell, after which he left directly. This is a no-go for an expensive device like this and I hope that Bergsala will reconsider their cooperation with this company. Or at least contact them about this (see the review about DPD on my profile).
I recently bought a Nintendo 3DS, but the outer cameras weren't working properly. That's why I sent it for reparation at Bergsala A/S. This went perfectly and I'll write a review about them as well. DPD delivered my repaired 3DS back to me today. Around 10:30 this morning my doorbell rang and I ran as fast as I could, because I don't like to make people wait. It's not like we have a huge house or something, it took a maximum of 15 seconds. When I got at the door, there was no-one visible through the glass. Just to check, I opened the door, only to see a package sitting on the door step. This was a package with my 3DS, just put there. There was no delivery guy in sight and it the van was also no where to be seen. My only conclusion: He put the package there, pressed on the doorbell and ran to his van. Even if it was something worthless like a 50 Kr. t-shirt this would have been a horrible service. Thinking of the fact that now it was a 1300 Kr. device makes it even worse! DPD, no thank you. I'll stick to Post Danmark.
I got my iMac repaired about 1,5 week before Christmas and picked it up on "lille Juledag". As soon as I turned it on at home, I noticed that the screen was looking great, so I was very happy about that. But also, at the same time, I noticed a "hissing" sound. After downloading some software, with which you can manually speed up and slow down the fans, I found out one of the fans (the CPU one) is hitting something inside my iMac, which generates the noise. See it as if you put a playing card on your bike wheel to simulate an engine sound (everyone has done this as a kid). Today, first day after Christmas, I called ELGiganten and the only option was that I would bring it in to the shop again. This is ridiculous, as it's something that can be repaired on-site, as long as you have the right tools for it. First they break something and now I have to lose my computer again for about 2 weeks without it being my fault. I was always thinking "ok" about ELGiganten, but this is just changing my opinion about the shop. Looks like I have no choice but to bring it back.
I have bought here previously and I was very pleased. Recently I won a gift card and decided to go back and buy a lot of stuff. The prices are very reasonable and the sending is pretty quick, if you think of the fact that they are German and therefore send from Germany. Customer service is fast too (used Facebook) and I love the bonus point system! Another good thing: Of the 100 grasshoppers, 98 were alive when they arrived! That's a record for me, as previous shops always had multiple dead animals. Thanks! I won't forget this shop.
I ordered a poster of a photo I took on the 30th of August and received it today the 6th of September. Yes, that can go faster, but I chose for the cheap sending (49 kr) instead of the expensive one (99 I think). They printed my photo on perfect paper and the quality is brilliant! I was honestly a bit afraid of the quality, as the program I used to send my picture (software they provided) made my image look very blocky. All in all, I don't understand all those negative reviews (and that's not because of the Danish, as I can read and speak it ;).
I ordered a camera on Pixmania on Monday. It was sent on tuesday to Kastrup. Apparently they chose a company that goes by foot, as the package takes multiple days to go from Kastrup to Århus, with a day of rest in Taulov. These days a 1-day-delivery (ordered before xx:00, delivered next day) is so common, that it feels like a really long time before I finally get my package. I'm hoping it arrives tomorrow (will edit then), but it's clear that you shouldn't order here if you're in a hurry. It's smart though that they send packages as if from another company, so they delivery guy doesn't think "aaah, Pixmania! That must contain some expensive stuff!". This is a message to Pixmania: Find another delivery guy, even if it's Post Danmark, because this one is too slow. When they change delivery company, I will easily give 5 stars, but for now it just takes one star away. My ordernumber: CCL1218147398 Edit: In some weird way they delivered my package this evening anyway, even though on the tracking page it says it's still in Taulov... Well, I'm a happy owner of a new company now :) One thing: The camera has only one manual, and it's completely in French. It was not mentioned on the website that I was buying a French camera. Of course the software is in any language you want, but the manual is not. Luckily I found it online.
On the Pixmania website the product was in stock. It said it was sold by GamePIMP, no problem at all, so I ordered it. After 6 days, I suddenly got a message from Pixmania that my money was gonna be refunded, so I called Pixmania to ask why. They told me that GamePIMP requested the money to be refunded and the reason was that the product was not in stock. The Pixmania employee couldn't help me further, so I had to contact GamePIMP. On the contact page they claim to answer emails within half an hour, it's now 2 days ago and still no answer. Meanwhile, the product is still in stock on Pixmania (see screenshot) and on their own website. The product I wanted to buy is "Halo Reach Legendary Edition" for the ridiculous amount of Dkr 19,27. On their own website it's also in stock, but for a price that's 55x higher than on the Pixmania website, namely Dkr 1.099,- I'm not resting before I have my game or a reasonable explanation of what's going on here. As a boycot I ask everyone here to order the "Halo Reach Legendary Edition" through Pixmania for Dkr 19,27, so they hopefully get the message SOMETHING is wrong. @GamePIMP: If you read this, please reply to my email that I sent on monday or just send my products. For the record: I'm naming Pixmania a lot in this review, they helped me great. I'm not referring to another company, but to the man-in-the-middle, because GamePIMP sells through Pixmania. Edit (28-7): Until now I still have not received an answer and my second order of the product is canceled too. The product is still in stock on Gamepimp.dk. What a crappy company. "We aim to answer your emails within 30 minutes" my ass!
Bought an iPad2 on release date (25 march), with an error, namely "Backlight Bleeding" (see image). I went back to the shop I bought it in (Fona StorCenter Nord, Århus) around the 1st of April where they gave me a number of a guy in Fona Søndergade (Århus), whom I had to call and explain the problem. He acknowledged the problem, and after that he put me on a list of reservations. I have an "White iPad 2 16GB WiFi only" by the way. Now, after more than 3 months of waiting, I still have NO new iPad 2. I tried contacting their complaints department (open until 14:00) yesterday at 12:45, but no one was there to answer my call, so I left a voicemail. I also sent an email, but it's still left unanswered. After more than 3 months of waiting for a replacement iPad 2, I'm getting pretty sick of it and am starting to think of taking more steps than just emailing and calling. Leaving a review here is my first step. If it's not solved before Friday the 15th of July, I'm going to take further steps. @Fona: Please PLEASE come with a solution! 3 months is rediculous! I even have the feeling that people who just want to buy one and are on the reservations list are in front of me? Isn't that a bit weird? Shouldn't the people with a BROKEN product come before people with NO product?!
My TV started showing a vertical line from top to bottom on the left side of my tv, after 1,5 years of use. As I bought it in Holland but live in Denmark now, I of course contacted Philips Denmark. They claimed, however, that I did not have a right of warranty. "Products bought in a foreign country have only 1 year warranty" is what they said. I looked up the European law and found that, no matter where you buy a product, as long as it is within a EU country, you have the right of 2 years warranty. I called Philips Denmark, but they didn't move. I called Philips Holland, where they told me that I indeed still had warranty. I called Philips Denmark, let them hear the recording I made of the employee saying I had the right on warranty, but still they wouldn't budge. I called Philips Holland again, where my case came higher up in the system. After 4 days I got an email from a high employee in Philips Holland, who claimed he talked to Denmark and they should call me soon to set up a repair. After 4 weeks of calling back and forth, I finally got confirmation that I was gonna get a repair. Half way through June, my tv (with new panel!) started showing a blue spot. I called Philips to tell them that I had an error again, said I bought it in Holland on the 9th of July, on which the woman answered "oh that doesn't matter, you have 2 years warranty within Europe". So my complaining in February actually helped, as everyone gets 2 years now, not only Danish customers. Because the first time was so terribly difficult, but the 2nd time very easy, Philips gets 4 stars from me. It just took some time to get the repair, but eventually it came.
In february an error started to show up on my tv (a vertical line), after which I contacted Philips. It was a bit difficult to get it fixed, as I bought my tv in Holland but live in Denmark now. The European law states that, wherever you bought the tv, as long as it is within the EU countries you have a right to 2 years of warranty. After a few back and forth calls between Philips Denmark and Philips Netherlands, Philips Denmark gave me the repair. Within a week after Philips agreed on repairing it, there was a guy of InfoCare calling me that the parts were in and that he wanted to make an appointment to do a "hjemmefix", so I did not have to part with my tv! The guy completely disassembled my tv, replaced the panel and it worked like a charm. He must have been inside my place for about 3 quarters. Perfect service! Sadly enough, a blue spot started showing on the panel midway through June, so I called philips again who directly contacted InfoCare to order a new panel. Today, 8th of July, the technician came to replace it. And again after taking good care of my tv, it works like a charm, without blue spots. Great extra: My tv runs out of warranty tomorrow (2 years ago I bought it), but the panel has an extra 6 months warranty. Nothing bad about InfoCare from my side!
The best parts are that they often have a catwalk video for the clothing, and they put the exact lengths of the clothing part in description box.
With all those rental car firms you read a lot of painfull experiences. I have  (after a couple of days reading all the shit from different people about all these firms) decided to go to cicars. Ok, it is maybe not the cheapest but certainly the one with the best build-in assurance. Next time a choose cicars again.
After I called the hotel to switch the date. No problem and I received within one minut a new confirmation. That's what I called service
The site is pretty quick and complete. I like the downloads that are available!!
The car rental overall went fine, no problems and everything was arranged like it should. As usual there was taken a deposit from my bank account however, the amount that was paid back was much different than the deposit account. I have emailed about this over a week ago but still have not received a reply.
Good website and gives a good representation of other sites.
They are very cheap and they ship the same day or the next day! I got it within a week, from the UK to the Netherlands! Super!!!!
I received items I never orderd. Due to the fackt their website messed up. Allthough The items I originaly ordered are still in my shopping cart they claim it's my fould. I will never order again.
I just saw trustpilot pop up when i was looking for the bookdepository site. I have no clue to why the rating is so low!! I have purchased many books through the years, and i have nothing but praise for this company. Yes, sometimes it takes a while longer for the books to arrive, but hey..... they ship for free! Amazon doesn't and i have had to wait for them too. As to the customer service, i once contacted them by mail and got a very friendly reply the next day and the issue was resolved. The only thing that would make this company any better for me, would be if they started selling ebooks again. I would wholeheartedly recommend this seller to everyone who is ok with their books not arriving in two days.
Good shop for motorcycle parts, easy to order and perfect quality.
We had a good impression of the city and enjoyed the tour. Very friendly personnel and the stops and starts simply to find. Again next time! Theo Vink
I ordered an item from this webshop and returned it because it didn't fit. They refunded me a smaller amount because they didn't know how to refund it on my creditcard correctly. When I asked them to refund me the remaining amount I had to give my account number in the Netherlands and they would transfer it into my account. Because they didn't refund in euros I had to pay transfercosts to their bank that was more than the amount I received! When I complained about it they said that it wasn't their fault and I just had bad luck! Obviously this webshop doesn't care about their customers and does'n give any good service. I don't recomment anyone to buy there if you are not sure about your order or size !!!!
Dear all, This review is a general overview of the website as it comes to me. I was looking for a certain type of watch, and PrecisionTime had it. PrecisionTime appeared to be the cheapest of ém all, and they had 24 hr delivery. After a comparison on the net, i ordered my watch . I got an confirmation email, and a track and trace code. Which worked perfect for me. Since i ordered on Fridayevening after 20:00 they emailed me that they could not deliver the next morning, so it changed into Monday.Which was fine with me, since i had some time. I got a update when my package was delivered at the delivery adress and everything went smoothly. I would recomment PrecisionTime.co.uk to everyone, since they offered me such a good service. Best Regards, Dennis
I bought a € 200 ($266) low-voltage exhaust fan (ventilator) with low-voltage adapter / timer for my bathroom about 7 years ago. $266 for a bathroom ventilator is rather expensive, but I valued the quality of the one I had before. Two years ago the thing started to make more and more noise and half a year ago the engine / fan part broke down. No bigggie; these things can't last forever. So I contacted Xpelair for a replacement part but they suggested I buy the entire package again, just to get a fan engine which should cost no more than €40 / $50. Which would leave me with a worthless $200 adapter. They do offert replacement housing / covers and fan blades for the ventilator though but not the only moving part which obviously breaks and provide no service. I suggest finding another manufacturer if you value service and value for money.
I ordered som clothes for my daughter for the first time at boohoo.com and three weeks later i still have not received my order. I have contacted customer service twice regarding this matter, however this issue is still unresolved. I buy a lot online and never have experienced such a delay in receiving my order from any other shop from the uk. i am very disappointed that a week after i contacted Customer Services for the first time i still did not know what happened with my order.
They not only have many games for a very good price, you don't have to wait for days after payment. You get your key instantly and you can start playing which is what you want. They have great sales on hot games and your inbox doesn't get spammed with email. Just once in a while an email about what is happening at the moment.
A good website where you can easily make amazingly good intro´s. The only problem is that you will be losing around 7 dollar if you want to make 1 intro in a resolution of 1900x1080. You can make a intro for free but then you will have a resolution of 480x270 with a big trademark on it.
There are some great torrents on this website. This site is realy nice if you want to download movies or games for free. There are some virusses on the site but usually the torrents are good
Eforchina is a website where you can buy a lot of stuff for realy cheap. My first order came from china to the netherlands in 2 weeks. The second order took one month to arrive. The products are good but there is one thing that is annoying. The custom service is not so good, so if there is something wrong its hard to solve the problem because they barrely understand english.
I am recommending Wallpaperdirect already a lot to people I know, as * their collection is vast * their products are competitively priced, especially compared to shops over here * they have a very apt and personal customer service * their delivery to the Netherlands was quick and secure
I used groupon a couple of times. It is nice that it is cheap. but the company's only make 1/4 of what the normally earn. so they tread you as a cheap customer. the lose money on you and the blame you for it a little bit. When you buy something you cannot go there whenever you want. you get special days and times that they deal with all the groupon people. this way you dont get the treatment you would normally get at a restaurant or a golfclub. this is where i went, never again though
I like the website so far, we'll see if i'm satisfied with the product once I have it in my hands ;)
We reserved a car online at our hotel for the next coming days on vacation. We were picked up on the time we requested to the car rental where they took the time to explain all the terms and insurances. Even tho it was one of the "cheapest" car, I have nothing to complain about it. It was cleaned on the in- and outside before use. After the term was over, they had picked up the car at our hotel. Can recommend Cabrera Medina to everybody.
Had never heard of Bestseller, but I would definitely buy from them again. My parcel arrived within a couple of days of ordering, everything as I'd ordered, nothing I could complain about really.
Easy to order, very fast delivery and fast refund in case of return. Perfect...
I ordered a few weeks ago by amazon. I live in Belgium, it is free shipping, best prices. 1 Word = Verry Good
Im from Amsterdam and my girlfriend lives in sweden. They deliverd perfeclty on time the flowers on our anniversary!
The booking with Cardelmar went very great, as usual. When we came at the Hertzoffice at the airport, the employee was not very friendly. She highly recommended several insurances that I did not need, because Cardelmar has an Allinclusiveplus insurance. At that time she told me that if there would be just a little spot on the car, she would claim an amount of 850 euro! Ridiculous! Other times we make reservations with Centauro, and we never had any problems. Next time no Hertz for us...
het paste prima op het hoofd van mijn zoon en zag er prima uit heel tevreden ben ik
Jammer dat door de sale de levering 1 week duurde.
Always on time and alway a lovely bunch of flowers
The best thing you can give to a good friend is to advise him or her  One.com. I got the tip One.com 5 years ago! It works great , also to build quick a beautiful site, using Webcreator! Geert
I was very happy with the prduct that Drukland.nl sent us. They were quick in their response and delivery. The only setback was that DHL did not deliver in time so I had to pick up the order myself at night.
I booked and prepaid a car in Italy through their website. Only after paying I found in the confirmation email that we need a creditcard in the driver's name, which wasn't the case. My friend - who doesn't have a CC - was the driver, and I (don't have a driving license) paid. In article 9.3 of the T&C it's even stated that a different card can be used as long as the holder accepts liability. We've done this before, I just sign for liability, so I had no worries. When getting to the office in Italy the very unhelpful, unfriendly worker said that it was in no way possible to let us drive off with the car if the driver didn't have a CC. In the end we (not her!) suggested to add me as a driver, but of course there was a price: EUR 40! Keep in mind I don't even have a driving license for a car, this was just some administrative scam. Besides this, it was possible to pay online with a different name, why shouldn't that be the case at the rental office? And why no warning before hitting the payment button? Then came the deposit. Turns out this is a whopping EUR 1200. This was mentioned nowhere in the T&C nor in the confirmation. I have an Amex credit card which can easily cover that, but Green Motion doesn't accept that. My backup creditcard only has a limit of EUR 1000, so I couldn't pay for the deposit. The only way to lower it was to take an extra insurance for GBP 5 a day. For five days that would be GBP 25, but the Catania office charged EUR 75 for it! Seems like another scam to me, but in the meantime I already paid the car and the extra driver. The worker told me I could cancel the whole thing and that the only way I could try to get my money back was hrough the UK backoffice. I figured that wasn't going to happen and reluctantly paid up again. I just wanted to leave and finally start enjoying my holiday. At that point I was still hoping for some customercare from the headoffice of Green Motion. After explaining the situation through email I got a reply basically saying I should have read the T&C and that my money was gone. Besides that they said the worker did her best, which was far beyond the truth. In no way did I get a reaction about using a different credit card, me not having a license, or the extremely high conversion rate for the extra insurance. Altogether I paid an extra EUR 115 on a EUR 155 rental price. Money I'm afraid is lost, especially after reading the other reviews. So beware for renting with Green Motion! They might be cheap to start with, but they have lots of hidden tiny letters in the T&C which boosts the price. Als check which company you end up with when renting through a website like rentalcars.com, it might be Green Motion. And you want to stay as far away as possible from them...
I recommend OKS because it's very easy to pay. I got my key delivered within 24 hours (it wasn't in stock because the game was popular) and I got very fast and helpful support from the support team! I will buy all my keys here!
I did pre-order SimCity in April. Payment was succesfull via PayPal, but the system of CD Keys discount didn't accept my order. So I did contact them and they manually accepted my order. I did got my key on the release date. And they also have very fast support at Facebook!
I ordered a nice bunch of flowers for my friend. It was her birthday. I expressedly asked in the "comment box" to let me know if the flowers would be delivered that day. I received no feedback and when I called late afternoon to ask about my order, I was told that my flowers would not be delivered due to a technical issue... After a few calls back and forth, I was told that the chosen colour was not available, if I would mind a delivery the next day and a different colour. I agreed, but even the next day no delivery! This is my experience with Euroflorist.
Ordered a number of bike parts from them; took them about two weeks (and a phone call) to actually send >some< of the articles. The rest they appear to have no interest in actually delivering. Called three more times, and three times was lied to - "you'll get the articles by the end of the week", "we'll send the articles today", "they've been sent already". Edit: I did get a package, post-date >two days after< my last phone call. It's contents: one of the articles, and the money paid for the two not delivered - nicely >taped< to the order sheet. Never again from this shop.
I ordered a bunch of mixing supplies and am very happy about the quality. The ink on the syringes is not wiped off like its water based so I can still read the contents! Bottles are well bottles, they hold their contents without leaking!
De levering is snel. het is fijn dat het gratis is dat is ook een reden dat ik het online bestel en retout is ook gratis dus top.
Company with2 easy to use websites, which offer you more then enough items to choose from. However do mind not everything is in stock, but you will be contacted by a personal (BIG PLUS!) assistent during all of your purchases. They will help you out as good as they can and try to supplement you with other items if your desired one is not in stock. Apart from the fact that they are trustworthy in buying your goods from, the only downside it takes a few days before they ship out your order. However in my own experience it is not that big of a deal. The shipping you pay for arrives withing 5 days, they work out the order within 3 days. Also what I find usefull about that is that you can add items after your order is completed, by incidental order (to quickly add something to the list by mailing your assistant. Anyhow this company is really outstanding in the way they operate and they have a success formula. This is the reason Chinese companies are on a big way up into the economic market worldwide!
Drukland.nl helpt me improve the quality of my flyers and I will most likely use there services again in the future.
Bought Diablo3 here today. Great prices and great quick service. I was able to play within 5 minutes and that is something us games like!
I would recommend this pass to my friends when visiting NY for the first time. We had a 5 day pass and by using this pass, we had the possibility to see the many attractive spots. What we enjoyed was the possibility to use bikes for a 3 hours tour in  Central Park. The boat trip with the water taxi was a very nice experience too! The fact that the pass has so many different possibilities, not only museums and famous skyscrapers, makes it very attractive in my opinion!
The materials used for Goliath shoes are amazing. I can walk miles on them and they are as comfortable and great looking as ever. ~ Signed a Goliath fan
Ordered a Nexus 10 tablet at a very good price. It took somewhat long before the order was actually processed and shipped (4 days) but once shipped I got it in two days (comes from Hong Kong). I contacted their support and the response was quick. The package was very well and carefully packed. The charger had no EU-power connector, but they delivered (for free) an adapter. I will no hesitate to reorder at eglobal in the future ...
Delighted with my Pierre Cardin rimless glasses. I appreciated it very much that I got an e-mail from SelectSpecs to let me know that there was a slight delay in the production of the lenses.
Best shop around on the internet with a great after sale service, very competitive prices.
Toplenzen is place to go if you want to order contact lenses. A well constructed, easy to use website that takes care of the order process in a few easy steps. The order history section makes repeat ordering even easier! Sharply priced and with 24 hour delivery if the lenses are in stock (and ordered before 14.30)  toplenzen "does what it says on the tin"
I have ordered two glasses for my wife and myself, they arrived fast with FedEx - UK to NL and the items where the exact selected models and they were well packed. We have got also a voucher of 10% for next purchase!
Onlinekeystore is one of the best keystores I know. Their website has a good overview with a cool design. Also important is the methods of payment, they are so easy to use! Thanks to their quick processing of payments you always have your key within 24 hours! EDIT: I bought a product (that should include a special bonus map), they gave me the wrong key that did not include this. I expected a new serial (a right one) but instead they just gave me a refund which is not fair at all. The meaning of buying a game with special features = I want that, else I could have bought it without.. This was my fifth and last payment!
Love the maxi dresses and skirts! Boohoo.com is an awesome webshop with good prices & fast delivery (even to The Netherlands)! For regular visitors like me, the "New In" section is very nice to see new items. So, I love it.
no complains at all; fast service, shipping costs are okay, unlike other companies that charge A LOT for their shipments. so I'm very satisfied!
First ordered battlefield 3, There was a little problem with the delivery but they keep us updated on the website. So i thought i buy call of duty modern warfare to kill some time, key was delivered in 5 minutes. And now i also got my battlefield 3 key, so modern warfare 3 and battlefield 3, for only 40 euro's, Thats really cheap, I want to thank CJS for the great service and i will definitely return here.
Communication was perfect and I received my order very fast, even from Italy to Holland. Recommended!
There is not much to say if everything goes well. It did with this product. Fast delivery
So let me tell you about Green Man Gaming. They have 2 G's in their name for an obvious and simple reason because the things they do also start with a G. Great Games Great Deals Great Site Great support Other then that I would not know what to say about them. Well maybe that my game collection exploded in size since I found them and my wallet never became full again.
The service is correct and a lot of beautiful bags.
I bought some stuff that is really so much cheaper that I decided to buy here, and not in my own country, which would be easier..  The difference in costs is that much!!!
ik ben een leek op computer gebeuren maar de uitleg en het stap voor stap te doen is het toch gelukt ben echt te vreden
I bought a Lenovo All-in-One computer Think Centre Edge 92z. From Centralpoint it was the cheapest on internet and the customer service were so kind as to help explain that whilst it was cheaper than the 91z, it had infact better specs. The computer arrived quickly and on the day promised.  The only worry was that a specific delivery time wasn't given and it was written on the email that it could not be delivered by the neighbours.  Luckily I was at home, though the delivery guy for GLS said he always tries to deliver at the neighbours where possible so it was worry for nothing. Customer service also helpful when I was setting up the computer and couldn't get the wireless mouse to work properly. I first had called Lenovo Support but could not understand what the person was saying. Centralpoint gave clear and easy to follow advice. Will definately order from them again in the future.
Vilayer offers cheap servers but the consequences is a not reliable server/service. I do not recommend this service I suggest to spent 2/3 $/€ more to get a real reliable server and customer service. My experience with gameservers.com is great. The customer service is really reliable and they offer good quality servers. I DO NOT recommend vilayer.com Update: I change from 2 stars to 1 the reason for this is that they aren't refunding my last order (which I never had caused by a mistake).
a good gameshop with a fast delivery this shop is in one word great
super lamps! they're even brighter and clearer than my old regular lamps, and you can just see the electricity bill going down even when you got the light on all day long! Ended up buying some more!
the part was difficult to find but cms could deliver. sadly I could not see on the site if the parts were in stock . and after I pay I could see that it would take 3 weeks. but in the end I have my parts and it is the original  so I will look at cms next time I need something difficult or oldtimer
Perfect location. Parking space next to the building for a reasonable price. Ben Yehuda, Jaffa street and Old City within a few minutes walking distance. When you want to experience Jerusalem to the fullest this is the place to be.
DO NOT ORDER ON 118GOLF.CO.UK! Here is why: I ordered on Dec 31 a golf bag as a birthday present for my husband. On Jan 5 I receive a message that my package will be shipped by UPS. Great! I even got a tracking no. But still (today Jan 12!) UPS has not received my package from 118golf.co.uk in order to ship it to me (Holland). I once receveid a reply from the Customer Service Manager Holly Gosheron, but only with my tracking no. And now no response anymore and my money has been taken from my account too (credit card payment). I think the positive reviews of 118golf.co.uk are false (from company itself), so please DO NOT order with them, even though they are a bit cheaper than competitors like cgdiscount.golf.uk or golfstoreeurope.com.
Skin care that is very simple in use and does what it suppose to do. Take care for the skin, who doesn't fit in a type skin.
Cardelmar is a trustful party to rent cars, never contract issues, safe choice
I bought transformers fall of cybertron. What is got was a key from the two year older war of cybertron. I asked for the right key and i got no response. So is asked for a refund and my key was removed but i got no money back. In Short DON'T TRUST THESE WANKERS !!!!!!
I ordered something whilst living in Holland to deliver to a friend in Denmark, I could pay with my creditcard without any problems and the package was delivered within 2 working days.
We had booked a room for 6 days at the hotel Grand Balisani Suites at Seminyak/Bali with Hotelclub and the hotel was even much better than expected! The only down side was the reception: which were rigid and unwilling to think but the room was superb!
Even een misverstand over de levertijd, maar verder een mooie radiator en prima levering
het is net wat er stond snelle levering en een correcte afhandeling en een prima prijs
The staff at Knivesandtools.nl are knowledgable and will stop at nothing to achieve customer satisfaction - Thank you! Recommended.
veel keus in Kong speeltjes en ideaal dat ik ze zo snel al in huis had !
levering was goed, maar jammer dat de pizza niet echt meer warm was
volgende dag lag de levering al op de mat , topper deze winkel
dit is een prima webwinkel met een team dat weet waar ze mee bezig zijn
amazing quality of clothes, fit and style for the awesome price of 5 pounds. Shipping is so fast (order reached the Netherlands in two days). Only thing is the shipping costs. Would buy infinitely more clothes if the rate was lower.
excellent shipping time, quality of luggage as described. overall very recommended shop
Ordered a lens for my Canon camera. Within the week the product arrived. It was well packed and in excellent condition. Shipped on a Tuesday, the product arrived already at Wednesday. Will definitely order new products in the future as prices are 27-28% lower than at local stores.
Had to wait more then 4 days to get it delivered in Belgium but very cheap and good service.
The bouquet was not exactly as expected but the service was good
They respond promptly to any questions, all goods delivered in a very timely fashion. Well packed. Based on first order no cons, would recommend this company. Oscilloscope ordered came without a manual, for me no problem, guess that's the same wherever you order something Chinese.
I've been an ASOS-fan for quite some time now. I've never had any problems with my orders so I can't say anything about the customer service, but the prices are good and the orders have never been late.
The navigation of the website is very simple. The search option is very good. The service after the booking is one of the best there is on the internet. You get emails and even text messages in order to help you to make your trip an unforgettable experience.
Het was weer lekker pizza taco speciaal plus een hot Frietje hot jammer dat de frieten in de saus dreven een beetje te veel van het goede
Zou er zo weer bestellen. Communicatie is prima en snelle levering
I was told to leave a review about the product received, but unfortunately I haven't received my order.....
Ordered so many on this website, and got never any problems. So i don't understand the bad rating...
We were very pleased with the quick delivery. At first we were a little nervous because we live in the netherlands and we did not know if and when we recieve the goods. But everything went perfect. We are certain that we will order again on the site of proswimwear.
Company is solid for years, so very trustworthy in my opinion. Price levels are good, however most of the time not cheapest. Reviews from other users are however my main reason to buy at DX. Shipping time takes a bit longer compared to orders done at ebay. But that's no problem at all. After sales is fine, they give good solutions, and quick responses.
I really like the website. They always have many nice clothes and their delivery service is fast. No complaints, I would recommend it to anyone!
About 2-3 weeks before our trip our owner cancelled the reservation. House trip contacted us and we found anouther apartment slightly more expensive, but we did not have to payt extra. Unfortunately we had to pay a ccleaning service of 80 dollar, which the original apartment did not ask.
The guitar arrived very quickly and was wrapped with care.
my  thinks that have become in the netherlands is ferry good,and it was fast in to my home. The marmite is excellent en the pudding also to. ill thank you for that,and to the next order. greatings from holland.
With this review I had to switch to English. I can talk and write a little German, but I think noone would understand my review very well. I've bought multiple PC's from CSL Computers. I think a total of 4 now. Every time the PC was shipped according the timeline within a week. The packaging is good, so even a trip to the Netherlands was no problem !! I did have an issue with a coupon code that I got from a previous order. It didn't work anymore and said that it already had been used .. Not possible, so i wrote CSL an email. The next day I already recieve a neat email back. It should be no problem, I could order the PC right with the mail and I got a dew hours later the bill. Here was the discount from the coupon already in the price! Perfect Service, could not be better IMHO. I think that this is the reason that I order all new PC's (also for family and friends) at CSL Computers in Germany. I know, they also sell PC's in The Nehterlands, but the price is right (even GOOD) and the customer service is great! Also shipping and packaging is no problem, but that is maybe the only service that could be a little cheaper. Don't believe me ?? Just try !!  I do !
Got my laser treatment now 6 months ago, and I couldn't have been happier with the results. From intake to aftercare, the treatment was truly professional, efficient and care-free. All steps of the process are described in detail, and performed with care. The treatment itself was done quick and clean, and the results are simply amazing: 20/20 vision is back! Aftercare is also not budgetted upon. I had to come back -just to be sure- 3 times in the first week, just to monitor the progress of the healing process. Would recommend this to anybody, and not only because the reward-programm :-)
Ordering several items a few days before our holiday. All products were deliverd in time and everything was likewise on wgat you see at the site of babycare! The service and communication are very good. Thank you for your kindness.
ik ben al een helepoos lid en zal dat nog lang blijven.
While this host has good servers when they're up, they can NOT meet their uptime guarantee as shown on their website. My site's been down for 2 hours now with no response from support and no sign of improvement. Even though their site states 99,9% uptime, I can tell you this is not true!
I love watches - everybody knows!! Normally I have to search the entire internet for good offers, but now I only have to look ONE place. Watch2Day - the place where time counts!
Thanks for the great watch. Lowest price I could find on the internet and free shipping!!
My business cards were a bit spotty, as if the quality of the image was not good enough. I hoped that the quality would have been better. Great service about the delay of my package and good answers to all of my questions.
for choosing an hotel and to get the real feedback it is  the best to go to tripadvisor.
snelle levering en erg prettig en ook de goedkoopste voor zo ver ik weet
doen wat ze beloven en hun service prima in orde
It was IsasI first time to place an orda at this intanet store, Dem have kept dem word within evaryway... Delivery wise and quality wise, so dem have earned dem 5 stars for sure... Selah
It was the first time we ordered at Boohoo.com , my son saw some nice clothes and it was good they have mentioned the precise measures, so we knew exactly it would fit him. He was very happy when it arrived so quickly, we are very content with the service.
BUYINCOINS are scammers. Extremely slow shipping. If you asking for DHL or Hongkong post they will use China Post.  They wont dispatch your item directly but will waiting till end of the week after they collecat all of their orders. Seems to be its cheaper for them to collect all order first before they disptaching en of the week. A MESSAGE TO ALL BUYERS ON EBAY: If you see that you dealing with buyincoins on ebay, just give them a directly negative feeback after you recieved your item..
Scammers!!!!!!!!!!!! Seller never dispatch any items i have buy from them. Do not waste you time on this webshop
I ve ordered 3 times in 2 monthes. first time because i wanted to see if this website was trustworthy. the order came within 7 days and was perfect. most outfits were exactly as on the pictures. good material because of the low pricing and no shipping costs i ve ordered so much more for my pug.. have told all my friends about the site! Very nice.. Will keep on ordering in the future!
After almost 20 days I still have not received my order. There is some confusion too about a DLC that is suppose to go with my order. All I am getting from support is automated messages. And they take 2-3 or more days to reply. There is no way of really getting in touch with zavvi apparently. I will never order here again. I rather spend 20 % more then ordering something @ zavvi.
Ordered tickets from the hotel. Once at the busstop next to the White House, we have been waiting for more than an hour before the bus arfrived. ...  Due to the traffic according to the persons selling tickets at the busstop, but how come that 4 competitors busses passed by before the first Big Bus arrived ? Same issue at Arlington: Had to wait for almost 50 min for a bus to arrive. Then at the transfer, between the 2 lines, had to wait for 30 min and then were instructed to wait for the next bus to arrive because our bus was suddenly out of order. So multiple bad experiences all on one day !
The general pricing is good and with the wide collection there is something for anyone.
Ik had het product snel gevonden op de website en had het op de aangegeven dag in huis!
The most annoying: when you search for a place for 1 person, it will show rooms as being as cheap for 1 person, but when you click through you'd have to pay for 2 or 3 people to be able to get the room. Really, if you already know how many people want to stay there (1) how difficult can it be to show the price for the minimum amount of people to stay there. Secondary, it's really annoying it doesn't remember all fields from previous bookings, so some fields you always have to fill in. With placing reviews about hostels it's even worse, you always have to specify age, amount, reason etc. etc. every time (which get's really crappy if you're staying in different hostels for months and you do want to review them)
Bought a Sensa Calabria road bike at a massively reduced price. Merlin only had one size and it was perfect for me.Great service and would have been quick delivery if it wasnt for the Dutch post office who put the wrong delivery codes on the box and the bike spent a week in the wrong distribution centre. I will of course be using Merlin again as i have for a number of years now.
I decided on a different color of the item ordered and sent a mail requesting the desired colour. This was answered withun 24 hours, in a Saturday no less.  The item, with the desired colour, was deliverd in a couple of days.
I used to order a lot at the H&M shop online, but lately I don't like their collection so I don't order. After changing the online webshop it looks messy and is not customer friendly. What I completely dislike about H&M shop online is that it takes ages before you got your order. Sometimes it takes over a month, because H&M keeps changing the delivery date.
ik ben heel tevreden over de levering s tijd en over de bril ben erg tevreden
I had flyers printed, to present myself at a tradeshow for wedding photography. One side of the flyer was printed too light with too little contrast. I was very disappointed at first. I filed a complaint but it took a week before Drukland responded (after me phoning twice). Once somebody got into it, the service became excellent! They figured out what went wrong the first time, and improved the file. They reprinted everything for free and the result was very beautiful! So the only improvement they could make, was to respond a bit faster, but perhaps they were very busy. I'm a happy customer now and already placed two new orders. I will recommend them.
I am satisfied with the product, also the delivery service was super fast. I strongly recomend this webshop and of course the Argan olie. Tatiana San Segundo
The quality is not that good, but still a very nice suit.
I have bought many games through simplycdkeys now in the last 1.5 years, and never has there been any problem (the keys are always a little later than announced, I just ignore that) and the prices only seem to get lower over time. Much recommended.
but allso many scammers who dont send you anything after purchase,so ebay need to up it security and protect there costumers more
is Google, but like your best friend, it allso does know many information about You. I hope google will change there way of collecting info bout the  users. But i use it Daily, cause google finds me everything!
High fee , but trusted and service is not that bad.
bestelling via de site die netjes is afgewerkt, de levering was lekker in de ochtend.
I love the ease of use of the Momondo site. It is no nonsense, straight forward and gives all the information you need about flight duration, transit time, lay over. Unfortunately noticed some pricing errors with for instance Russian companies. To increase reliability you can easily indicate that the price given by Momondo ain't right to increase reliability of their site. I always double check whether or not they have the best prices and 9/10 times they have found the best prices around. Looking for a convenient ticket price search partner, that's Momondo for sure. Highly recommended.
I made a reservation. A small change had to be made. Very good service, I got a telephone call wenn I already were travelling.
I bought a watch from watchfinder as a birthday present. the website is easy to use and the service was great, both pre- and post purchase.
My only problem was the 'Track and Trace' service: My order came a few days after the day the day it should come, so I was worried if it was all right. But it was and I am happy.
I did not know what to do with my Groupon code. Mary was a great help. Thank you!
My first clothes I bought at boohoo was great! But now it was very disapointing. I ordered a onesie for my doughters birthday and it came in time. On the pakkage was writen the right size but on the label in the neck of the onesie you could see it was a different size. To small! Today I send the onesie back for the right size.
When we arrived at the airport Reina Sofia, Tenerife we saw long queus for some car rent offices. Not so at the Cicar office where there was no waiting and the service prompt. The car was as expected. We always drive automatic cars and not all companies supply these but Cicar does. The return of the car was also very easy and quick.
Amazon was perfect in the past, but then they switched to using Royal Mail to The Netherlands and the packages no longer arrive. So will not be ordering there again.
The only thing is that when you buy for example 500.000 fifa coins for like 29€, and you get the beginner discount, which I got, the price will be somewhere around 28€. As I continue to the iDeal, I need to pay like 30€. A bit annoying and unfair. Anyhow, it is a good site to buy your fifa coins from.
I live in The Netherlands. I wanted to send my sister-in-law in London a 'thank-you-bouquet". At first I tried a Dutch company that also delivers worldwide. But this was very expensive. Than I found Teleforist. Much better prices and delivery next possible day.
Even though the product I ordered wasn't in stock, it was promptly ordered from the supplier and delivered to me in The Netherlands within a reasonable period. The choices on the site were outstanding and the prices definately good.
ik had ze s'middags besteld en de volgende dag al in huis, was er erg blij mee
No further comments, your Honour. Even correspondence was swift and to the point.
De bestelling was na 1 dag al binnen en het gevraagde zat ook in de doos.
By our next visit to London we will book it again!!
I really like the clothes i bought here, not all items in the shop appealed to me, but I managed to find some that did. Really positive about the price and the time it took to get the items to my house.
I always look for clothes which is outspoken and that other people would'nt wear. On the site of Boohoo you can find different great styles. With those styles you can identify yourself with clothes. Briljant!
Ordered , shipped and delivered in two days !!! Great,would use it again any time one to recommend !!!!
The service is cheap and several times a year the website will go offline for a couple of hours and some times days (!) before repairs are made.
Bought guild of wars trilogy cd-key. As soon as the payment  was finished I could collect my key.
Superdry has got very well-made, good quality and super fast delivery!
very complete site. handling of order nice an accurat. messaging about order very nice
Incredibly cheap which made me doubt the legitimacy first, however after looking up some reviews which for a change did not look to be written by a company employee, I decided to go for it and order. The system is quick, safe, easy to understand.... However you need to pay close attention to the instructions! All in all a very good place to get your games at a bargain!
Great site that makes finding, comparing and booking hostels worldwide simple and fun
A website connected to an application that does what it's made for. The websites is not always the fastest, but it always functions as expected. Orders by credit card work excellent. Games are downloaded with easy and playing is just as simple. Compared to retail stores it is cheaper, but is pretty expensive when you realise the way they convert dollar to euro.
I just bought a pair of shoe from shoeline.nl, and tell you what, it was perfect. I got the shoes in only 18 hours, so fast delivery and great quality of the shoes as I was expecting. I will definitely use this website again and again. I am so happy with my purchase and with finding this great service. CHEERS SHOELINE !!!!
Fast delivery and good service. Bought my machine here 4 yrs ago and never shopped somewhere else. Perfect machine and filters.
This appartment is just what you hope for. Its on a good location in a quiet neighbourhood just a few metor/tram stops away from the city center. Its located between the old East and the old West. The pickup of the keys was very easy and the payment also went very well. A good place to stay in Berlin.
We took a privatefly Cessna from Olbia to Zurich, the crew were very friendly and made our whole experience very pleasant . we will surely use the book and fly services again
The price was right, quality product , shipping was not expensive and fast. I will order again at FC-moto
zeer snelle levering en een levering die in orde was
I booked at the advertissement I received on my computer for the free voucher of 20 £. I didn't saw that it was only from Dover till france and not the other way. Then I politely asked If I could cancel that booking because it was chaeper whithout the offer and they answered that all the terms and conditions are on the site and I I deleted it there would be no refund. So now I have booked a more expensive ticket and no voucher.
We are very happy with the custome and the very good handling and very very fast delivery. Thanks from Belgium
I ordered some stuff (which was all availble, atleast that's what their site said). and because i hadn't received a confirmation of the shipping i mailed them and they told me it would be send the next day. few days later still no confirmation so i mailed them again. something had gone wrong so they would ship it the next day what eventually happened. the emails were a small efffort but very effective (answered the next day). It was worth it because of the low prices.
prima echt na een dag in huis , lekker kop koffie
Quick delivery, item was double wrapped! I'd buy here again and recommend this shop to anyone who wants something out of the ordinairy!
I ordered a rucksack from Trekkinn.com because of the wide range of choice and the attractive price. The costs of delivery were surprisingly high with a choice of next day delivery by DHL or 3 day delivery by DPD. I opted for the cheaper 3 day delivery since I had more than a week before I needed the pack. Soon after placing the order I was send an email saying the order will arrive next week at the warehouse. This surprised me and angered me. First of all, why did I pay such a high delivery charge if the order wouldn't arrive within 3 days anyway?! If I had been foolish enough to opt for the next-day option I would have lost even more. Secondly, the warehouse is not my address. The information is irrelevant and deceiving. The telephone number mentioned in the email (for questions) did not exist. The telephone number on the website was answered by a answering machine that put me on hold. Mind you; the number is Spanish and being on hold won't stop you from being billed. After a while the line is disconnected. This is not a fluke, I've tried it several time on different days. This is policy. At this point I became suspicious and started to realise this website could be a scam. After a written complaint on the website (no email available...) I was told the order would arrive 'around' two weeks later... I hastily cancelled the order and alerted my credit card company. I lost faith with this reseller.
I was a very happy Amazon UK customer for years until they suddenly stopped offering free delivery to all European countries (except Ireland). It wasn't the fact they ended free delivery but the way they did it: all non-UK / Ireland customers received an announcement they stopped offering free delivery the day AFTER it went into effect! This was a very rude thing to do and the company should've given their customers the opportunity to order the things on their wish lists or even the stuff in their basket free of delivery charges. Most people who complained about it received a generic email and nothing was done to explain why this was handled in such a rude manner. The disastrous way they handled this makes me avoid Amazon UK for as long as possible; even if they'd re-instate free delivery I will prefer to buy my stuff at other online stores. Stores that DO care about their customers.

Overseas orders are handled very efficiently. Even in the busy days before Christmas, my order took just a few days to arrive!
It was the first time I ordered flowers with Regiobloemist. It was a very pleasant experience: friendly people on the phone (if you have a question) and quick delivery.
I ve just bought some motoer equipment from FC-MOTOR company ,and I suggest that you should have a look at the prices and articals they have , I won't look any further because should I need any equipment than I know that FC-MOTOR got it and cheap as well. A very serious company to look at
All the logistics were excellent - the communication upfront was timely and complete (conformation of reservation, payment arrangements, links to further interesting travel information) and the contact person in Paris itself was very friendly and helpful (if a bit rushed, since we arrived during one of the busiest periods of the year). They do expect you to a) have a mobile phone with roaming facilities with you, and b) be confident enough to call the contact person yourself. The apartments themselves were a little quirky and in a slightly less perfect state than the pictures on the site suggest - though that is always to be expected - but good value for the money.
Order arrived a couple of days later. I thought something was missing (but it was actually in the box) and called them. Issue solved within a minute.
They delivered within 1 hour and everything is working. Great company !
Good service, at first I was bit impatient, but due to security issue they wanted to verify that the charge made to my credit card was legit. Once that sorted, everything perfect. Good communications and no issues at all....
Easy to find what I am looking for. Absolute no problem to upload my different accounts.
I was kind of worried about ordering a breakable product (such as eyeshadow) via a webshop. But my order arrived very fast, and the packaging was very sturdy. They really made sure nothing could be harmed during shipping. Also, I love the fact that they offer premium service, which includes a free luxe sample. It really makes internet shopping more fun.
A clear website. My instructions were completely followed and I was told that the flowers were beautiful.
In my travels Vodafone has never let me down. I always had an available signal.
It's a perfect way of travelling. In western Europe there is often an airport available within a 2 hours drive. Service / Prise... For so little money one cannot expect VIP-service. It should be easier as a passenger to take personal luggage in to the plane. And not only a relative small piece.
Delivery was on time but the packaging was a bit sloppy
This outfit has plenty of goods on hand that are strong, take a lot of abuse and come out shining. If you do need some strong outdoors gear this is the place to look around.
Cewe's tools indicate delivery times, but it seems to be rather production times. We received an e-mail stating that our book was sent out while it should have been delivered the day before.
I love asian brands but I couldn't find them anywhere online. But at yesstyle they have so much to choose from ^^ I was also looking for those korean facial sheets I couldn't find anywhere, cuz you can't buy them here in Holland :'( I was really happy when I found them here and a big assortment too ^^ I'm really happy I found this site xD
i`m driving a Honda Nighthawk from 1983 and ofcourse i need to replace some parts. At  CMSnl.com i order my stuff and within one week i always get my new parts in perfect conditions at home! Keep going this way so will i...
Found this web shop by accident. So many carpets in so many styles, unbelievable. We saw a nice one and ordered it on Monday evening. Thursday afternoon it was already delivered. Unfortunately we made a mistake concerning the color, it didn’t turn out as we had in mind. We asked for advice and got very good help, service, advice and response by e-mail. No problem returning it and order another one instead. Two days later we had our second carpet in house and this one is a stayer, really beautiful colors and quality. We are very happy with it and will recommend this warehouse to everyone who does not want to search for weeks for a new beautiful carpet.
I think that Macintosh computers have absolutely superior design and performance.
Fantastic payment system that makes your shopping online truly safe.
I purchased a battery for my LG P920 3D telephone which should provide my telephone the juice it needs for a longer time. And it does. Finally I can make plenty of 3D captures and pics, allow my kids to play games and watch movies when they are bored, and continue to stay reachable by phone without having to charge it until I'm home again. The battery supplied by LG with the phone would have died on me way before that. Item was delivered a tad late, but FREE shipping worldwide from non-EU countries! Try that at Amazon for just 1 item. The back cover supplied with this battery is perfect and has the same feel as the LG original that came with the phone. Everything as in order and it still works, so I don't have experience with their customer service (yet?).
My experiences with Big Dennis are excellent. Not only do they deliver fast, but at a good quality/price ratio. And they even have a client service, that lives up to the word. They have been thinking with me on a solution for my wish and came up with the perfect product for my need. I can recommend Big Dennis to anyone. Paul
I am from the Netherlands, and I use this site all the time. I love the rates and the accurate discriptions about the hotels. On my last booking i had some questions, but i somehow couldnt contact the UK or Irish number.. After asking my question on the Facebook page of Alpharooms, they asked me to send them my mobile number, and i did. I was contacted within an hour and all my questions were answered AND i got help with the booking. Excellent service over all, thanks for this.
Buildabrand is great for early stages of logo design of new projects or quick design of several logo's for new clients.
Good prices, much cheaper than the pet shops in the Netherlands.
High quality products and excellent service.  If only they could do a little extra for good customers , I have been ordering quite oftten and never got a discount !
I requested a quote to get a view how much it would cost to move a volume to the USA. Besides responding me with an email I got immediate a phone call some someone of the company who guided me through the entire process and answered my specific questions.
I ordered the D7000 which was not available in The Netherlands. Price was good, very fast delivery of less then 1 week for abroad delivery, which is outstanding. Fotokoch updated me regularly about the delivery. I'm very pleased with the overall service of fotokoch.de
Any battery that you need: they have it at BatteryChampion. The help desk (via email) was very responsive. Although they could not guarantee that the product that I had chosen would work on my laptop without BIOS modifications, they said: simply order it, if it does not work as expected, you can send it back and we'll reimburse the full amount, including the expense for sending the product back. But the product worked perfectly, so I had no need to send it back :-)
Tons of products, all extremely low priced. I've ordered many times already and have never had a negative experience. The only minor downside is the shipping time, but there's nothing that DX can do about that, and moreover, what do you expect for the offered prices :-)
Significantly cheaper than most webshops in The Netherlands and with free shipping abroad I order almost everything I need there. Great, user-friendly website with almost anything you need. Shipping usually takes only three working days. That's faster than most 'foreign' webshops.

The order we placed was immediately executed and the parcel arrived in no time. The contents were in good order.
De site is overzichtelijk en er was een snelle levering
De levering was heel snel en ben heel tevreden over het kleedje van mn dochter,het is super mooi
I stayed with my family at miami beach and we needed a car. Beause appearently taxi's can't drive with toddlers under the age of 4 without a car seat. They will get pulled over by the police so we had a big trouble and money issue was getting a problem to pay $ 20 for a round trip for 1 person. Luckily we found Dollar and a they offered a good deal for renting a car with a car seat for children and with navigation. the service was excellent the car was nice. So for family's with children toddlers i recommend to think about it to renting a car with child seat because it will make it much easier to go out with your family. greetings from holland, Amsterdam
Mick helped us very well. He improved the delivery speed, generated new solutions for our material-needings and called me back for extra technical info. Conclusion: highly recommended company to order materials.
Great website, very user-friendly and reservation was done in only few clicks. And it's free which is really great. Update: I've just been travelling through Jordan & Israel for a few weeks, hostelbookers was a great help here, as they make it very easy to make a reservation for nice hostels by smartphone.
Products were ordered, payed using Paypall and delivered in 3 days. Shipment was packed in a proper way and tracability was all right. At first sight the quality of the products is not at the highest level but very interesting prices.
Prima, de levering was zoals afgesproken. De dag na bestelling lag het pakketje al in de bus.
I was busy with another company trying to get my world trip booked, but since I have been in contact with Roy I switched and no regrets about this. He made my world trip even better than I was dreaming for, and helped me very smart to make some decisions. I would recommend Roy from Travel Nation without any hesitation to everyone who like to get inspiration, good knowledge around the world, good personal advice and last but not least, everything for a good price! And a good laugh while doing everything in a very professional way. I am ready to go around the world!
Regiobloemist België is a site you can really trust : it delivers a quick and excellent service.
They went out of their way to get a shaving stand corrected after I figured out that the shaver did not fit. They even send me a new shaver just to make the set fit. Absolutely perfect experience.
After breaking through my choice fatigue of payment options, I chose one. My key arrived in less than 5 minutes and another 5 minutes later I was playing my game. Instant delivery, cheap (too bad there's a CC-fee) and loads of options. What do you want more?
Ging geweldig via de site bestellen en de volgende dag had ik het pakketje al.
Within a day they found the glasses in the color I wanted, very helpful and friendly over the phone
na me bestelling had ik de 2 bandjes binnen 2 en halve dag al in huis super hoor.

We had a great time in New York using our New York passes! It was very easy in use and we visited all the attractions we wanted to see and more!
If you want to surprice someone somewhere in the globe, i can just recommend Floraqueen. I have send flowers to my girlfriend in Rio, I live in the Netherlands and everything was just perfect. The flowers looked amazing, delivery was spot on time.. So just amazing..
I am glad to reciep the pen in very good packing
I am in overall satisfied with the service and bought a lot of things here, the main advantage is the fast delivery. However, the brands are so so and your promotional emails are lying - you trick people to subscribe to the newsletter for 10% discount, but I tried it several times and have never received any discount. Also, it would be nicer if your boxes were plain, better for reuse.
I made my order from Germany and the delivery took only three days. That was even faster than many of the domestic online-shops need to ship. As the assortment of brands is so amazing, it won't be the last time I ordered my shoes in your shop.
Ordered the same bag from a local webshop first, got no response whatsoever. Decided to order from Heinnie for the first time after reading a lot of good reviews and boy were they right ! Definitly not my last order from Heinnie.
De aanbieding van de dag al een dag later in huis, prima!
like  the ease with which I was able to rent via the Internet, the efficient and expedient way the rental was handled at Schiphol , and the car was as described= clean, modern and in good condition
I bought pure Jamaican black castor oil for my hair. The product arrived really quickly, and easy to use!
I LOVE Hostelworld, getting access to the best and cheapest hostels/accomodations on the whole world It's save and easy to book, no unexpected surpirses, no extra costs and also possible to vieuw passed and future bookings, which makes it easy when wanting to return somewhere In 1 word: EXCELLENT
very well done. my order was complicated for both party's... handling was great... thnx jeff
Have been using this website since 2005. The all-inclusive deals are a must, especially in the USA.
I wanted a special order that wasn't available on the website (just a certain kind of flower). I got a speedy response to my email and they made it very easy to do this. Just excellent! Would definitely recommend and order again!
Delivery was fast and the items were in good condition and as described.
I think Tinydeal is just a scam. I ordered some small things wich got delivered so i was satisfied. Until i ordered a more expensive item (tablet PC), wich they haven't delivered yet. I am waiting for more than 4 months now and the only thing i get is their well known 'post office' excuse. This same thing happens with to many people to be a coincidence. Please AVOID Tinydeal at all times and shop at more relaible plases like DX. Tinydeal is a scam and fraud company.
Hey, You're an artist are'n't you? Then why go for mainstream stock products while you can stand out in that crowd with the exclusive line of wonderfull instruments and equipment provided by the Doctor... Treat yourself and make a difference the Lovetone way...
The site was really easy to navigate and I had a great time designing the sleeve. The order went through fast, had the package in mere days. Product was of great quality, sturdy. Only thing I would like to comment on is the print was a bit dark, maybe tip people about that during design process?
If you like to shop on the internet and you're a skater, surfer or snowboarder, Surfstich is one store you must have in your favorites list. Need I say more?
Service is good. Clothes are good. No perfect rating, because of the following. I ordered some goods. One of them was sold out and I was only told 6 days later.
Very quick delivery, good price/quality. nice that two deliverys in three days were seen as one delivery and delivery costs were returned. thanks for the service and the nice products, and so quickly.. .
Very quick in sending the order, always good products, particularly the Eneloop line - clear descriptions without fancy marketing magic. I have purchased 5-6 times in the past years and I keep coming back for new supplies. The web site can make use of a bit of update, perhaps add better categorization, facets with filters on price and type of battery, add a form factor wizard that can recognize the alternative form factor aliases, particularly for the button cells. Other than that - just perfect!
Ordered some strings to be delivered in France. Unbelievable how efficient the order was handled
The delivery is so quick and presentation of the package super nice. The retour is also arrange quickly . Super good  products and service.
pity it took just 4 and a half months to deliver my order
In just 3 days time we received our order in very good condition. Chapeau!
We ordered two items and got a timely message first of order confirmation, later of shipping confirmation with tracking number for each item. A day later we received message that one item was not available and that money would be refunded. The message did not mention which item was cancelled. Since the price was the same of each item, we had to write to ask for the item number. When we got the reply with the item number cancelled, it did not mention anything about future availabilty. Again had to write asking if and when this item would become available again. Clearly cancellation messaging could be improved to give faster clearity. But every time we did get a fast reply and we got the feeling that our concerns were taken seriously.
- prices offered are competitive - shipment is fast & provided with a tracking number which is important - customer service replied my emails within 24h overall good experience
Fast shipment, low shipment costs & sharp prices for the products!
I ordered twice so far, and both times I was surprised on how fast my package arrived. According to the site it would take 5 - 10 days for it to arrive, but both times I got it in under 5 days already. I don't know about returning products because I didn't return anything.
good and quick way to arrange a holyday home on a short notice
Very nice display, good materials and looks very professional !
I had ordered a multisystem dvd player, which I wanted to use oversees. I had a deadline for the item and specifically had mentioned that when I placed the order. The item was shipped in a timely manner and also the interesting thing about the whole transactions was that I was given a follow up call by the company to make sure that my dealine for the item was met.
The shipping and payment is fast and easy, and it's neatly organised. On the other hand there are problems with the items which we're send to me. Customer service dealed with my problem in a good and proper order. Still there remains a problem with the inventory of the site and the products available. Therefore two of my orders had items missing or not send. This however is not so good. Still I applaud boohoo.com for making a good and easy accesible site with a great customer service. Since they are a new and upcoming site, I think it's best if they will start to work on a better inventory to get the orders more detailled.
Ik vond de levering prima optijd en het product was super
I ordered a product for the first time, from the Netherlands, was skeptical at first, but within the time limit my product arrived and I give powermyself a thumbs up!
It was a horrible experience. They charged me a good amount for delivery, which would be fine if they delivered on the day I asked. Not only that, the delivery guy came while talking on the phone, rang the doorbell and before the door was opened, he just left the flowers outside the door and left (I live in an apartment building, so anyone could have taken the flowers, though I was there within a min)! Even that would have been fine if the flowers had a note for the recipient, which I had specifically asked for. It was my wife's first mother's day and I wanted to make it special, but this ruined it. Will never order from you again
Quick and friendly staff. User friendly website with a lot of information available
The search button on the site is very helpfull. It's very easy to order. Nice that the site is keeping you updated about shipment.
Greate online shop with competing prices and I would recommend this shop to anyone. Also the special prices for extra items (like prov1x golfballs) you can buy with each purchased item is big pre.
They now what performance and service is people want in these days
This is my expericence: I was interested in the Lee filtersystem and a colleague attented me on Speed Graphic. In The Netherlands the Lee filtersystem is hardly to get and does cost much more than the Speed Graphic prices. I ordered several parts and got it wel packed a few days later delivered at home. So it was quick, accurate and priceworth! For some part I needed a personal advice. It was easy to get a staff member at the phone and he did help me very frienly and adequate! Thanks a lot. High recommended!
If you need business cards Smileprint is your partner. From ordering untill the fulfilment (the cards in your mailbox) it all goes as if in a flow. Within a week everything was settled and done with according to the promise.
I am always amazed by the diversity of books available on AwesomeBooks, ordering them and having them shipped overseas at no cost is just unbelievable. I am a big fan!
International shopping still feels a bit risky, but this is a company one can rely upon. Good services and good prices, you know what you will receive and it will arrive as soon as possible, well wrapped.
The clothes are very lovely and the price is aswell! I had some problems with one artikal and mailed about that. I got a nice and helpfull respons very fast. The only problem I have with boohoo.com is that it is placed in England. When a item doesnt fit and you want to send the it back the shipping can be very expensive if you don't live England is very expensive. It makes it a little risky to order something.
Around 10 days ago I ordered an Anno 2070 key from their website. The website stated they had 95 units in stock and delivery would take an average of 3 hours but 24 hours max. After 24 Hours: No key delivered. Sent an email but got no reply After 48 Hours: Still no key. Contacted them on Skype multiple times and finally they responded saying that the key would be delivered the same day. Now, 8 days after their last promise I still have no key. I Tried contacting the "support" multiple times but they ignore me on both email and skype. I Have cancelled the order 4 days ago but I got  no response to either the cancellation email, various attempts to call them via Skype or my Paypal dispute. This is clearly a company who doesn`t care one bit about their customers so I would advise anyone to go somewhere else to buy a key. Luckily there are plenty of other companies that do care about their customers.
A good choice if you want to book an appartment, easy going website.
Apart from competitive pricing  Aeroshop has shown to be a trustworthy  partner to deal with. Order handling and the selected method of shipping worked out perfectly
I got the product I bought within an hour (digital key)
I have already purchased several pens from Cult Pens and will be back for more for sure. The items are clearly discribed and shown in pictures and the transaction is easy and smooth. On all occasions the delivery was really fast and properly packed. A site to shop with pleasure! Cheers!
Original order could not be delivered, because those sunglasses were discontinued. Very quick feedback, changed my order and within a week my new beautiful sunglasses (silhouette) were already in the Netherlands. So much better than smartbuyglasses which I tried before. My next order will definitely be with otticanet again.
The service of the company is really good and the order is delivered very quick. All is wrapped up good and no complaints from me. I order a lot of Vinyl which they have a lot of in stock.
If you're looking for cheap and trustworthy, you have come to the right place. I was looking for payday 2 and found the best deal at G4k.me. Purchasing with paypal was easy and in about 1 houre I recieved the steam key. like I said: Easy and Fast.
de printer die ik nodig had heb ik op de website van Mediatmarkt gevonden en besteld, geode prijs/kwaliteit, ik had het de volgende dag al.
AwesomeBooks has been my main suplier of books ever since I discovered their site through Goodreads. They have always given me great reading copies of books for a decent price. Through their great offering I found books I would never have tried were it not for their great pricing. Their delivery is speedy and well taken care of. The few times I did have some questions their customerservice proved to be especially good in responding and helping me out.
I was so happy to receive lenses with ease and quick and smooth service. There was no catch, there were no tricky parts, just register, sign up, and order. That's the way I liek it and it saved me a lot of money as well. In most U.K. stores you are required to get a prescription (around 25 pounds) and other check ups which also cost you money. I already knew which lenses I needed (I am from the Netherlands got my prescription there) so I didn't need a new check-up! I just wanted lenses and Lestore helped me get what I needed.
My latest order was my forth order and the only one who had a little delay. The company told they had technical communication problems - please email. Also no response on my mail. On the average I'm pretty satisfied.
I recomend New York Pass in your first visit to New York!
excellent sevrice over the telephone, easy to order and super fast delivery to Belgium. I am a very satisfied custome, thank you!
We got a brand new Volkswagen Golf and the damage which it already had was cleary mentioned when we collected the car. It all went very fast and it was no problem to bring the car back before opening hours. We were very satisfied!
Perfecte service en dat ondanks de staking van de post bezorgers
i had some issues with the booking of flight from JFK to Frankfurt. They were extremely helpful and comprehensive when adjusting to my husband and daughter needs. I am really happy with their customer care service.
I am happy surprised with the customer service we got in our trip from to New York. We had some questions about the convenience to pay in Swiss Francs or Dollars; we ended getting what benefit us the most :) We will use it again!
Used cheaptickets for first time and I am really happy with it. They did showed a good comparison between all the different airlines from my flight AMS-LGW. I was able to make my booking quite easily. I will used it again.
I am a big fan of Jamón Iberico de Bellota. Every time I visit the sherry region (I am a wine merchant, ao specialized in sherries) I consume a lot of raciones of this delicous ham. For me it is the best ham in the word, better than eg the Italian San Daniele. To cut the ham properly geive me a lot of headache. You have to exercise a lot before you will become a master cutter!!
easy to navigate the site. pay through paypal. international delivery by DHL also good.
This is one of the best sites you can buy keys on! I suggest this to everybody!
not very handy that your first stop cannot start everywhere, you must start at the first stop
once used to the interface it is quick and concise
I needed a starting point in Chiang Mai, Thailand (January 2013) to find me a condo. Therefor I wanted a nice place for the first 8 days. I found it with Airbnb. I had a nice room in a small appartment with fantastic owners. Administration etc where perfectly handled. You get a nice clear email with all necessary info. So I will use AirBnb next time with no doubt.
It's so easy and so quick service. So far, I haven't faced any troubles with buying ''beltegoed'' online from this site. just try it.
Delivery is very fast and accurate. We have a company in the Netherlands and we received the pens in a few days. Cult Pens is superb! Jacques Janssen | The Netherlands
Our first booking with Wimdu. London host accepted our booking (and our money) and two minutes later e-mails us, that the room is not available, but "do not worry, we have an alternative for you". Without giving any information about the alternative, even not after our request to do so. We cancelled our booking. It took Wimdu 6 days to conclude that our cancellation was correct. We are still waiting for our money to be refunded (11 days now and counting). Hope we will really get our money back. Will never book with Wimdu again.
Connect you with a car rental company to rent a car for a very reasonable price. Just does what it supposed to do. It's an company I would recommend! No bad commends. Thomas
after paying via Paypal , I hoped i could watch concerts on my flat screen . The company did not deliver the content they promised. So I had to claim via paypal and got my money back after a month. I believe Iconcerts an i-concerts is a SCAM !
I ordered a safety chair from The Netherlands. Even including the charge for post and packaging, it was 40 euro's cheaper than in our country. The delivery was within one week.
We bought the City Pass, because it seemed profitable, but it turned out to be more than that: cheap, quick entrance, great circle line cruise. To put it shortly: never visit New York without it, enjoy the priviliges, at an unbeatable price.
I really thought that the parts I needed were unobtainable, searched the internet for days, no luck. Than I remembered that some years ago I ordered parts at CMS, recognized them by their logo.Indeed they kept their promise once again so i am a really happy customer and shall advise CMS to other desperate collectors.
I first bought a pair of pants in size 8. I usually have size 8 but when I got it it was waaaaay too small. So I payed 10€ for sending it back because I really wanted those pants. I ordered a new pair in size 12! That's normally way too big but when i got that one again it was too small, even though I messured everything to be sure it's the right size! The website said that i should have size 10, so I even ordered one size bigger. I'm very dissappointed and love those pants but I'm not spending that much money again to order a bigger one. Probably won't order anything anymore even though I love the clothes!
Excellent speed in handling and sending the article! Product in good condition as expected, trustworthy party to order from. Ordered twice from them, two times the same positive experience.
I ordered GTA V just a few days before the release and I got it exactly on the release date!!
Good car for a good price, all insurances covered and no hassle delivering it back.
Ordered one day, delivered next morning. No problems. Only thing...description of the carkit on the site was quite basic, appeared to be more difficult to build in. But so is the case at all webshop selling this device. A little warning would have been helpful.
This is just a great adult site, the site is not just looking at pictures, you can  follow the models and message with them , almost all of them also keep a journal that  gives you a peek in the live of them behind the pictures. As a member you can also make journal entries that the girls  also can read ( And some even reply) SO in all its like  a easy going socail like site , just one that also has naked ladies.
I have recently replaced Norton with Auslogics Antivirus and have to say that I am very happy with my choice. Norton used to slow down my computer to a crawl at times while Auslogics is barely noticeable. If it weren’t for the crazy complicated installation procedure, I would definitely rate it 5 stars. There were a couple of moments during the install when I almost gave up on it. If you bare with it through the install, you’ll get yourself a great and snazzy-looking, quiet and effective antivirus. And for the money there really isn’t any alternative that would be as good.
Greenman Gaming is a nice site with great deals and little trouble. When it comes to gaming their not Green at all but are quite experianced in it all.  Alot of their  games  are via steam and there for are like little steam inbetween sales. Seeing that i have never had to call customer support vouches for them and their excelent service. This is also why they score a good for I hjave no idea how their customer support is.
I ordered 6 Panton S chairs on Wednesday and received them on Friday in The Netherlands. The quality for this price range is perfect.
I did order Assassin's Creed: Black flag including the game guide, and some other game guides. Since I preordered AC Black flag, the other game guides were delivered first after an announcement email of the shipping. The AC Black flag and guide were delivered on release date. Packaging of the shippings is very good; mostly in a large box. I did raise a question regarding my order and this was answered fast and accurate. I would recommend 12game.com to everyone!
ik had de doos met bubbeltjesenveloppen al heel snel binnen en zelfs om de buitenkant van de hele doos zat bubbeltjesplastic. perfect
Perfect site to find parts, buy parts and always perfect delivery!
I find it totally unacceptable to order a product, pay for it and be informed second day that the product cannot be delivered because they don't have it in stock. It seems that sometimes they ("unintentionally") say that a product is on stock, "sell it" and then pay you money back so that they can attract more and more people on the websites with their cheap offers. Well, I am still waiting to get my money back after last experience. All I've heard so far is "sorry, there is nothing we can do". Actually there is: once an order is placed, deliver the product. If you make a mistake, pay for it. It is that simple. Conclusion: a totally unprofessional shop.
Since I discovered Hostelworld, it's been a one-stop shop for me. I don't even bother trying other websites, or worse, searching individual hostels online, because up until now I've only gone to places that have hostels listed on Hostelworld. They have a large, varied selection of hostels (hotels, guesthouses, and more) that is easy to browse and search, and booking is always secure.
lovely flowers, very fresh and still beautiful after 2 weeks!
As above, you have the parts for the bike and get them delivered.
I ordered many times from Paddock and I'm very satisfied with their service! They are my preffered supplier in Land Rover spares.
